# Session 4: Research Synthesis + Problem Definition

**Thursday, March 26, 2026 | 6:30-8:00 PM | Online (Zoom)**

---

## Topics

- Synthesizing distributed research findings across diverse contexts
- Causal loop analysis: why problems persist
- Crafting a bounded, evidence-based problem definition
- Moving from problem to ideation (rapid idea generation)

## What We'll Do

- **Research Synthesis** (breakout rooms): Share what each team member found during the research period. Identify patterns across contexts, surprises, and contradictions.
- **Causal Loop Sharing** (full group): Each team presents their causal loop map (2-3 min). Discuss feedback loops and who benefits from the status quo.
- **Problem Definition** (breakout rooms): Finalize your problem statement. It must be bounded, evidence-based, actionable, and not a solution in disguise.
- **Peer Critique** (full group): Share problem statements in chat for quick feedback.
- **Rapid Ideation**: Generate 8-10 solution concepts in 10 minutes. No filtering. Then select 2-3 to develop as testable hypotheses.

## What to Bring

- Stakeholder Research document submitted to Canvas before class
- Causal Loop Map submitted to Canvas before class
- Your individual research notes in your notebook
