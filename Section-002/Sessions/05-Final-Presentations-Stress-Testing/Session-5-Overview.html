<h1>Session 5: Final Presentations + Stress Testing</h1>

<p><strong>Saturday, April 4, 2026 | 8:00 AM-12:30 PM | In-Person (McNair Hall 216)</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Communicating problem-to-solution arcs with traceability to research</li>
  <li>Stress testing assumptions and identifying kill criteria</li>
  <li>Iterating concepts based on peer feedback</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We'll Do</h2>

<h3>Morning (8:00-9:45)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Frame the day: "Show your thinking, show your evidence."</li>
  <li><strong>Final Presentations</strong>: Each team presents (8-10 min) followed by Q&amp;A and stress testing (4-5 min). Focus on problem definition, solution hypotheses, and traceability to distributed research.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Late Morning (10:00-12:30)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Debrief presentations as a group: What made them compelling? Where was traceability strongest?</li>
  <li><strong>Assumption Audit</strong>: Each team identifies 5 critical assumptions their solution depends on, ranked by importance</li>
  <li><strong>Kill Criteria</strong>: For your top assumptions, what evidence would disprove them?</li>
  <li><strong>Stress Test</strong>: Teams pair up for adversarial Q&amp;A. Your goal is to find weaknesses in each other's assumptions, not to agree.</li>
  <li><strong>Iterate</strong>: Based on stress testing, revise your concept or assumptions. What would you test next?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Bring</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Problem Definition document submitted to Canvas before class</li>
  <li>Your team's presentation (slides optional but recommended)</li>
  <li>Notebook</li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Show the journey from research to problem to solution. Traceability is key.</li>
  <li>Use specific evidence: quotes, observations, moments that mattered</li>
  <li>Acknowledge what you don't know and what assumptions you're making</li>
  <li>It's okay to say "we'd need to test that"</li>
  <li>This isn't a polished pitch. It's a demonstration of design thinking in action.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ongoing Notebook Practice</h2>

<p><strong>Find the Duct Tape</strong>: Make sure all your weekly entries are captured in your notebook before submitting.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Notebook</strong> is due before Session 6 (Thursday, April 9). Submit as PDF (photos/scans for physical notebooks).</li>
  <li><strong>Session 6</strong> is Thursday, April 9, 6:30-8:00 PM, <strong>online</strong> via Zoom. Reflection and course close.</li>
</ul>
