- **Group Sharing**: Volunteers share reflections. Draw out themes across the cohort.
- **Professional Application**: Where does Navigate Ambiguity show up in your work? When would stakeholder mapping be useful? What's the cost of skipping empathy?

## Reflection Prompts

These will guide your in-session writing. No need to prepare answers in advance, but feel free to start thinking about them:

1. Which of the 7 design abilities felt most natural to you? Which was most challenging?
2. Where in your professional context do you jump to solutions too quickly?
3. Think about your TETHER observation. What would you notice differently now?
4. What did you learn from your teammates' diverse contexts that you couldn't have learned alone?
5. What's one specific practice from this course you'll carry into your work?
6. Look back at your Find the Duct Tape entries. What patterns do you see?
