# Stakeholder Research

## Assignment Overview

This is your team's first major collaborative deliverable. During the two-week research period (March 12-26), each team member conducts observation or interviews in their own context, focusing on stakeholders relevant to your team's chosen scenario.

The power of this assignment lies in your team's **combined reach**. Each member accesses different workplaces, industries, cities, and communities. By coordinating your distributed research, you'll gather richer stakeholder data than any single-context study could provide.

## Learning Objectives

- Conduct empathy research (observation and/or interviews) with real stakeholders
- Coordinate distributed research across a team with diverse access points
- Synthesize findings from multiple contexts into coherent insights
- Identify patterns that emerge across different environments

## Instructions

### Individual Research (Each Team Member)

Each team member conducts **1-2 substantial research activities** in contexts they can access:

**Option A: Observation (45-60 minutes)**
- Observe stakeholders relevant to your scenario in your environment
- Use AEIOU framework: Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users
- Document in notebook; transcribe key findings for team

**Option B: Interview (30-45 minutes)**
- Interview 1-2 people who represent stakeholder groups in your scenario
- Focus on their experience, constraints, workarounds, and frustrations
- Take notes; summarize key quotes and insights for team

### Team Coordination

- Divide stakeholder types based on who can access whom
- Check in asynchronously during the two-week period
- Share findings in a team document before Session 4

### Team Synthesis Document

Compile your distributed research into a single document that includes:

1. **Research Overview**
   - Which stakeholders did your team reach?
   - What contexts did each team member access?
   - What research methods did each member use?

2. **Individual Contributions**
   - Context: Where/who did you observe or interview?
   - Key observations or quotes (3-5 most significant)
   - Surprises: What challenged your assumptions?

3. **Cross-Context Patterns**
   - What patterns emerged across different team members' research?
   - Where did different contexts reveal different facets of the problem?
   - What stakeholder needs or constraints appeared consistently?

4. **Team Stakeholder Map**
   - Build a stakeholder map for your team's project, grounded in your research findings
   - This is a new map specific to your team's scenario, not a revision of individual stakeholder maps from earlier sessions
   - For each stakeholder: What do they optimize for? What constrains them?

## Deliverables

Submit to Canvas before Session 4 (Thursday, March 26):
- [ ] Team synthesis document (PDF)

Your individual research notes (observation logs, interview notes, insights) belong in your design thinking notebook. These will be submitted as part of your complete notebook at the end of the course.

## Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)

This assignment is graded on a **Meets Specifications / Revise** basis. All team members receive the same grade.

### Specification 1: Research Breadth and Depth

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Each team member contributed at least one substantial research activity (observation or interview). Research covers multiple stakeholder types relevant to the scenario. Evidence of 45+ minutes of engagement per team member. Findings are specific and detailed, not superficial. | One or more team members did not contribute research. Research covers only one stakeholder type or context. Findings are thin, generic, or could have been written without actual research. No evidence of sustained engagement. |

### Specification 2: Distributed Context Advantage

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Team leveraged members' diverse contexts to access different stakeholders or environments. Document clearly shows how different team members' access points contributed unique perspectives. Research would not have been possible with a single-context approach. | All research was conducted in the same or similar contexts. Team did not leverage distributed access. No evidence that the hybrid format's advantages were utilized. |

### Specification 3: Synthesis Quality

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Cross-context patterns section identifies meaningful insights that emerged from comparing findings across team members. Patterns are specific and grounded in evidence from multiple sources. Team stakeholder map reflects research findings, not just initial assumptions. | No synthesis across team members' research. Patterns are vague or unsupported. Individual contributions are compiled but not integrated. Stakeholder map reflects assumptions rather than research. |

### Specification 4: Evidence of Genuine Research

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Document includes specific quotes, observations, or details that could only come from actual research. Surprises or assumption-challenges are noted. Research reveals information the team didn't already know. | Findings are generic or could have been assumed without research. No specific quotes or observations. No evidence that the team learned anything new from the research process. |

### Specification 5: Documentation Completeness

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| All four sections are present and complete: Research Overview, Individual Contributions, Cross-Context Patterns, Team Stakeholder Map. Each section has sufficient depth and detail. | Missing sections or significantly incomplete. Document is thin or padded with irrelevant content. Lacks sufficient depth to demonstrate genuine research engagement. |

---

**Overall:** Assignment meets specifications when ALL FIVE specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the assignment should be revised and resubmitted.
