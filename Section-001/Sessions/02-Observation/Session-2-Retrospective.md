# Session 2 Retrospective: Observation Through Video

**Monday, January 26, 2026 | Remote via Zoom (weather pivot)**

---

## Context

Session 2 was originally planned as in-person campus fieldwork but pivoted to remote video observation due to weather conditions. This retrospective captures what worked and what to adjust for future iterations.

## What Worked Well

### 1. Smooth adaptation to remote format
The pivot from campus fieldwork to video observation maintained the core learning objectives. Students still practiced sustained observation, documented findings in notebooks, and participated in structured debrief.

### 2. Strong debrief participation
Students engaged meaningfully with observations across the video series:
- Fashion, posture, and walking pace differences across eras (Ben)
- Personal space comparisons between Shibuya and London (Tushar)
- Camera awareness in historical vs. modern footage
- Details revealed by slow-motion (Joy, Justin)

The chat-based "drop one word" participation technique worked well for remote engagement.

### 3. AEIOU framework landed effectively
Introduced at the end per the Explore → Make Sense → Name pedagogy. Students were already generating observations organized around activities, environment, and interactions before the framework was named.

### 4. Observation vs. interpretation distinction
Multiple discussion threads show students catching themselves interpreting vs. observing. This is a key skill that transferred well to the remote format.

### 5. Magyar/Dadar video impact
The "no framing—let it land" approach created a distinct moment. The slow-motion footage seemed to reset attention and generate unique observations.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Attention decay during continuous video viewing
**Observation:** Rishi noted decreased detailed observations as videos progressed.

**Suggestion for next time:**
- Build in micro-breaks (10-15 seconds of silence + verbal prompt to "reset your attention") between videos
- Consider shorter excerpt durations if attention flags
- Move the most impactful video (Magyar) later in sequence to re-engage fatigued attention

### 2. Prompt order effects on observation
**Observation:** You noted that video presentation order influenced what students noticed—later videos benefited from comparison to earlier ones.

**Suggestion for next time:**
- Consider randomizing order across sections to compare results
- Or make this explicit as a teaching point about priming effects in observation
- Add a brief reflection: "How did what you watched first shape what you noticed later?"

### 3. Shadowing logistics consumed significant class time
**Observation:** Multiple individual coordination items: Tushar extension, Rishi extension, Mayur token use, Dyan/Felix confirmations, Dean Andrews outreach.

**Suggestion for next time:**
- Move shadowee confirmation deadline earlier (e.g., 48 hours before Session 2)
- Use a Canvas form or shared spreadsheet for confirmations to reduce in-class logistics
- Reserve last 5 minutes for quick status checks rather than extended troubleshooting

### 4. "Find the duct tape" assignment + weather conflict
**Observation:** Tushar needed extension due to weather-related difficulties.

**Suggestion for next time:**
- Clarify in syllabus how weather disruptions affect ongoing notebook assignments
- Have backup indoor alternatives ready (e.g., "find something improvised" in McNair Hall)
- Consider whether this assignment needs weather-proof framing

### 5. Timing adjustment mid-session
**Observation:** You adjusted the observation window timing to 2:30-3:00 during class, requiring a quick poll.

**Suggestion for next time:**
- If timing flexibility is needed, communicate adjustments via Canvas announcement before class starts
- Build in 5-minute buffer for logistics when pivoting formats

## Student Highlights

Notable contributions worth remembering:

- **Zeynep & Tushar**: Developed systematic observation strategies for tracking changes across contexts
- **Joy**: Noted how her focus shifted from environmental factors to other elements—good metacognition
- **Dyan**: Successfully cold-outreached Dean Andrews for shadowing
- **Ben**: Strong comparative observations on posture/pace across historical footage

## Carry Forward to Next Semester

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Add micro-breaks between videos | High | Combat attention decay |
| Earlier shadowee confirmation deadline | High | Reduce in-class logistics |
| Weather-proof "duct tape" alternatives | Medium | Indoor backup options |
| Make prompt order effects explicit | Medium | Teaching opportunity |
| Move Magyar video later in sequence | Low | Test if it re-engages attention |
