<!-- Subject: TETHER Observation - Due Session 2 (March 7) -->
<!-- Post: After Session 1 -->

<p>Your TETHER observation instructions are now in Canvas.</p>

<p><strong>TETHER = Take Extended Time to Hold Everything in Review</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Hybrid Advantage:</strong> Unlike a traditional course, you'll observe in YOUR environment—your workplace, a local coffee shop, public transit, your neighborhood. The diversity of contexts across our class is a feature, not a limitation.</p>

<p><strong>Key details:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>90 minutes of uninterrupted observation</li>
  <li>Choose a location where you can observe people interacting with spaces, systems, or each other</li>
  <li>No phone, no laptop—just you and your notebook</li>
  <li>Document what you SEE, not what you THINK it means</li>
  <li>Include a half-page reflection afterward</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Bring your completed observation to Session 2 (Saturday, March 7, 8:00 AM, McNair 216)</p>

<p>We'll do a gallery walk sharing observations from your diverse contexts. Your unique environment is an asset!</p>
