<h1>Design Thinking Notebook</h1>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>Your notebook is the artifact of your design thinking practice throughout this course. It contains your observations, sketches, maps, reflections, and in-class activities, the raw material of your learning journey.</p>

<p>Unlike polished deliverables, the notebook values process over presentation. It should show evidence of sustained engagement, not perfect documentation.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain a continuous practice of documentation throughout the design process</li>
  <li>Capture observations, ideas, and reflections in real-time</li>
  <li>Create a personal reference for design thinking practices</li>
  <li>Develop the habit of externalizing thinking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Required Entries</h3>

<p>These are the core notebook components that will be assessed:</p>

<p><strong>TETHER Observation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Full 90-minute observation notes</li>
  <li>Assumptions noted in margins</li>
  <li>Reflection on the experience</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Find the Duct Tape (Weekly, throughout the course)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Each week, identify and document one "duct tape" solution you encounter: a workaround, patch, or improvised fix that people use to deal with a broken process or poorly designed system</li>
  <li>Record: What is the workaround? What problem is it solving? Why does the "real" fix not exist?</li>
  <li>These entries accumulate throughout the course and should appear regularly in your notebook</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Individual Research Notes (Research Period, Sessions 3-4)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Individual observation/interview notes from your Stakeholder Research</li>
  <li>Raw research data: observation logs, interview notes, key quotes</li>
  <li>Insights and surprises</li>
  <li>These notes are your individual research record and will be assessed as part of your notebook grade</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Map Drafts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Working drafts of stakeholder maps from your team project</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Causal Loop Drafts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>First drafts and iterations of your causal loop map</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problem Definition Iterations</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Working drafts of problem statements showing how your thinking evolved</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optional: In-Class Notes</h3>

<p>In-class notes are not required, but including them can be a helpful way to demonstrate engagement throughout the course. Examples of what you might capture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Activity notes (ambiguity exercises, AEIOU framework, observation activities)</li>
  <li>Ideation outputs (problem framing attempts, hypothesis drafts)</li>
  <li>Feedback received from peers during presentations or stress testing</li>
  <li>Notes from other teams' presentations</li>
  <li>Reflections on what you learned in a given session</li>
</ul>

<h3>Format</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Physical notebook:</strong> Submit photos or scans (one PDF, pages in order)</li>
  <li><strong>Digital notebook:</strong> Submit as PDF with clear organization by session/activity</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We're Looking For</h3>

<p>This is graded on <strong>completion and sustained engagement</strong>, not on neatness or "correct" answers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evidence that you used the notebook throughout the course (not filled in the night before)</li>
  <li>Entries from each phase of the course</li>
  <li>Your actual thinking. Messy is fine, empty is not</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>Submit to Canvas before Session 6 (Thursday, April 9):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete notebook (PDF, scanned pages or digital document)</li>
  <li>Pages in chronological order</li>
  <li>Clearly legible (doesn't need to be neat, but must be readable)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)</h2>

<p>This assignment is graded on a <strong>Meets Specifications / Revise</strong> basis.</p>

<h3>Specification 1: TETHER Documentation</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Notebook includes substantial TETHER observation notes (3-4+ pages). Notes reflect 90 minutes of sustained observation. Assumptions are noted. Reflection is present.</td>
      <td>TETHER section is missing, sparse, or clearly rushed. Fewer than 2 pages of observation notes. No assumptions noted. No reflection.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 2: Session Coverage</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Notebook includes entries from each major course phase: Session 1 (ambiguity), Session 2 (observation/team formation), Session 3 (stakeholder mapping), research period, Session 4 (synthesis), Session 5 (presentations/stress test). Not every activity needs extensive notes, but each phase is represented.</td>
      <td>Multiple phases are missing entirely. Notebook only covers 1-2 sessions. Large gaps in documentation suggest the notebook wasn't used throughout the course.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 3: Sustained Engagement</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Entries show evidence of real-time documentation (not reconstructed later). Notes include context-specific details that wouldn't be remembered later. Handwriting/formatting varies naturally across sessions. Content couldn't have been created in one sitting.</td>
      <td>Notebook appears to have been filled in all at once. Entries lack specific details. Formatting is suspiciously consistent throughout. Content is generic enough to have been created without attending sessions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 4: Thinking Made Visible</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Notebook shows actual thinking: drafts, iterations, questions, dead ends. Includes stakeholder maps, causal loop attempts, ideation sketches, or other visual thinking. Evidence of working through ideas, not just recording final answers.</td>
      <td>Notebook contains only final, polished outputs copied from other deliverables. No evidence of drafting or iteration. No visual thinking (maps, sketches, diagrams). Reads like a transcript, not a thinking tool.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 5: Legibility and Organization</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Notebook is legible (doesn't need to be neat, but can be read). Pages are in chronological order. Clear enough organization to identify which entries correspond to which activities.</td>
      <td>Illegible or unreadable sections. Pages out of order or disorganized. Cannot determine what entries correspond to what activities.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> Assignment meets specifications when ALL FIVE specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the assignment should be revised and resubmitted.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>The notebook is your artifact, not a performance. We're looking for evidence that you engaged with the work, not for beautiful documentation. Messy thinking captured in real-time is more valuable than polished notes created after the fact.</p>
