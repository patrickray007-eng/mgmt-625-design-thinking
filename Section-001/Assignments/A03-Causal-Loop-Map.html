<h1>Causal Loop Map</h1>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>A causal loop map visualizes the system dynamics underlying your team's problem. It shows not just what the problem is, but why it persists: the feedback loops, reinforcing cycles, and structural factors that keep the problem in place.</p>

<p>This assignment helps your team move from "here's a problem we observed" to "here's why this problem is hard to solve."</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Analyze problems as systems with feedback loops and interdependencies</li>
  <li>Identify reinforcing and balancing loops that perpetuate problems</li>
  <li>Recognize second-order effects and unintended consequences</li>
  <li>Understand who benefits from problem persistence (and why solutions may face resistance)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Building Your Causal Loop Map</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Start with your core problem</strong> (center of the map)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>What is the problem your team is investigating?</li>
  <li>Be specific: not "communication issues" but "frontline staff feedback doesn't reach decision-makers"</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Identify contributing factors</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>What causes or contributes to this problem?</li>
  <li>Draw arrows pointing toward the problem</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Trace the effects</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>What happens because of this problem?</li>
  <li>Draw arrows pointing away from the problem</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Find the loops</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Where do effects become causes? (reinforcing loops)</li>
  <li>Where do effects dampen causes? (balancing loops)</li>
  <li>Label loops with R (reinforcing) or B (balancing)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Identify who benefits</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Who gains from the current state, even if unintentionally?</li>
  <li>Why might someone resist changing this system?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Map Requirements</h3>

<p>Your causal loop map should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At least <strong>8-10 nodes</strong> (factors/variables)</li>
  <li>At least <strong>2 feedback loops</strong> (can be reinforcing or balancing)</li>
  <li>Clear <strong>arrows with +/- signs</strong> indicating relationship direction</li>
  <li>(+) = as A increases, B increases</li>
  <li>(-) = as A increases, B decreases</li>
  <li><strong>Annotations</strong> explaining at least 2 loops and 1 "who benefits" insight</li>
</ul>

<h3>Format</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create as a digital diagram (Miro, Lucidchart, draw.io, or similar)</li>
  <li>Or hand-draw and scan/photograph (must be legible)</li>
  <li>Include a <strong>half-page written explanation</strong> of the most important dynamics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notebook</h2>

<p>Your first draft of the causal loop map belongs in your notebook. Use it to sketch out nodes, loops, and relationships before creating the final version. This draft work will be assessed as part of your notebook grade.</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>Submit to Canvas before Session 8 (Monday, February 16):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Causal loop map (image or PDF)</li>
  <li>Half-page written explanation of key dynamics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)</h2>

<p>This assignment is graded on a <strong>Meets Specifications / Revise</strong> basis. All team members receive the same grade.</p>

<h3>Specification 1: System Complexity</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Map includes at least 8-10 distinct nodes representing different factors in the system. Factors are specific to the team's scenario (not generic). Relationships between factors are plausible and grounded in research or observation.</td>
      <td>Fewer than 8 nodes, or nodes are too vague/generic to be meaningful. Factors could apply to any problem rather than the team's specific scenario. Relationships are assumed without evidence.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 2: Feedback Loop Identification</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>At least 2 feedback loops are identified and labeled (R or B). Loops are genuine cycles where effects eventually influence causes. Loops are explained in the written section with clear logic for why they reinforce or balance.</td>
      <td>Fewer than 2 loops, or "loops" are actually linear chains without cycling back. Loops are labeled but not explained. Logic of reinforcing/balancing is unclear or incorrect.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 3: Relationship Clarity</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Arrows clearly show direction of influence. Positive (+) and negative (-) relationships are marked and make logical sense. A reader can trace the system dynamics by following the arrows.</td>
      <td>Arrows are missing, unclear, or inconsistent. +/- signs are missing or don't make sense. Relationships are ambiguous or contradictory.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 4: "Who Benefits" Analysis</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Map or written explanation identifies at least one stakeholder or group who benefits from the problem persisting (even unintentionally). Explains why this creates resistance to change. Shows systems thinking beyond "this is bad and should be fixed."</td>
      <td>No consideration of who benefits from status quo. Analysis assumes everyone wants the problem solved. Misses the structural reasons why problems persist.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 5: Explanation Quality</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Half-page written explanation illuminates the most important dynamics. Explains why the identified loops matter for understanding the problem. Connects map to team's stakeholder research. Writing is clear and specific.</td>
      <td>Explanation is missing, too brief, or merely describes the map without adding insight. Does not explain why the dynamics matter. Generic or disconnected from actual research.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> Assignment meets specifications when ALL FIVE specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the assignment should be revised and resubmitted.</p>
