# Project 2 Research Guide

## The Goal

Between now and Session 8 (February 16), each team member should conduct **1-2 research activities**: observations, interviews, or both. You're building the evidence base for your problem definition and causal loop map.

This is not optional. When your team presents, we will ask: "What did you learn from talking to people?" Your problem definition should be grounded in real conversations, not assumptions.

## Two Research Tools

In Project 1, you practiced **observation**: watching without interpreting, documenting what you see. That skill still matters. Keep using it.

In Project 2, you add a second tool: **the empathy interview**. You've mapped your stakeholders on paper. Now you need to learn from them directly.

| Tool | What It Reveals | When to Use |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Observation | What people *do*: behaviors, patterns, workarounds | When you can watch the problem in action |
| Interview | Why people do it: motivations, constraints, frustrations | When you need to understand someone's perspective |

Use both. Observation shows you the surface. Interviews show you what's underneath.

## Empathy Interview Principles

These five principles will guide your conversations:

### 1. Listen more than you talk.
Your job is to understand their world, not explain yours. Aim for an 80/20 split: they should be talking 80% of the time. If you find yourself explaining your project or offering solutions, stop and ask another question.

### 2. Follow curiosity.
When something surprises you, go deeper. The most interesting insights come from moments you didn't expect. Your best follow-up question is often: "Tell me more about that."

### 3. Ask for stories, not opinions.
"Tell me about a time when..." is almost always better than "What do you think about..." Stories give you concrete details, emotions, and context. Opinions give you generalizations.

### 4. Embrace silence.
After they answer, resist the urge to immediately ask another question. Wait a few seconds. People often fill the silence with something more honest or more interesting than their initial response.

### 5. No leading questions.
"What's frustrating about X?" assumes X is frustrating. Try: "How do you experience X?" Let them tell you what matters, rather than confirming what you already believe.

## Good Questions vs. Bad Questions

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Don't you think the onboarding process is broken?" | "Walk me through your first week at the organization." |
| "What do you think about the feedback system?" | "Tell me about a time you tried to flag a problem." |
| "Is it hard to access services?" | "What does a typical day look like when you need [service]?" |
| "Do volunteers feel appreciated?" | "Tell me about a moment that stands out from your volunteer experience." |
| "Why don't you just...?" | "What have you tried? What happened?" |

## Setting Up an Interview

1. **Identify who to talk to.** Start with your stakeholder map. Who can you actually reach? Prioritize stakeholders you know least about.
2. **Ask for 20-30 minutes.** Keep it manageable. You can always go longer if the conversation is productive.
3. **Explain briefly.** "I'm working on a class project about [topic]. I'd love to hear about your experience. No preparation needed."
4. **Take notes by hand if possible.** It slows you down in a good way. If you want to record, always ask permission first.
5. **Go where they are.** If you can interview someone in their work environment, you'll learn more than in a conference room or over Zoom.

## During the Interview

- Start with easy, warm-up questions ("How long have you been in this role?")
- Move toward the topic gradually
- When something surprises you, follow it
- Write down direct quotes when you can
- Note body language, hesitations, and energy shifts
- End with: "Is there anything I should have asked that I didn't?"

## After the Interview

Within 24 hours:
- **Write up your notes** while the conversation is fresh
- **Highlight 2-3 key insights**: what did you learn that you didn't know before?
- **Flag surprises**: what contradicted your assumptions?
- **Share with your team**: your findings are team resources

## Combining Observation and Interviews

The strongest research uses both tools together. Consider this sequence:

1. **Observe first.** Watch the environment or process before talking to anyone.
2. **Interview based on what you saw.** "I noticed that [observation]. Can you help me understand what's happening there?"
3. **Observe again.** After the interview, go back and watch with new understanding.

Your observations give you questions. Your interviews give you answers. Then your observations give you better questions.

## The Research Expectation

- **Each team member**: 1-2 research activities before Session 8 (February 16)
- Activities can be observations, interviews, or both
- Document everything in your notebook
- Share findings with your team before Session 8
- Your Causal Loop Map (due Session 8) should reflect what you learned from real people

## Tips for Your Team

- **Divide stakeholders.** Don't all interview the same person. Each member should target a different stakeholder or context.
- **Share as you go.** Don't wait until Session 8 to compare notes. Quick updates keep everyone aligned.
- **Capture direct quotes.** Exact words from real people are more powerful than your summary of what they said.
- **Track your assumptions.** Before each interview, write down what you expect to hear. Afterward, note what actually happened. The gaps are where the insight lives.
