# Session 2: Observation Debrief + Team Formation

**Saturday, March 7, 2026 | 8:00 AM-12:30 PM | In-Person (McNair Hall 216)**

## Topics

- Sharing and comparing TETHER observations from diverse environments
- The AEIOU framework (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users)

- Project 2 scenarios and the full project arc (Sessions 2-6)
- Team formation around shared scenario interest

## What We'll Do

**Morning (8:00-10:20)**
- Share TETHER observations with the class. Post key findings, walk the room, spot patterns across different contexts.
- Debrief: What did you notice about noticing? What did others catch that you missed?
- Learn the AEIOU framework and apply it retroactively to your observations
- Individual problem framing from your TETHER. Draft a preliminary problem statement.
- Share problem framings in small groups

**Midday (10:20-12:30)**
- Preview the full Project 2 arc and the 6 scenarios (business and nonprofit)
- Read scenario one-pagers and choose based on interest and access to stakeholders
- Form teams (~5 people per scenario)
- Begin initial team exploration: What do you already know? Who can you access? Map your team's combined reach
- Preview the research period and upcoming assignments
