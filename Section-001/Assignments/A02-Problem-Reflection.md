# Problem Reflection 1

## Assignment Overview

This reflection closes Project 1 (individual observation work) and prepares you for Project 2 (team-based scenario work). You'll examine what you learned about observation, problem identification, and your own tendencies as a designer.

## Learning Objectives

- Synthesize learning from [[A01-TETHER-Observation|TETHER observation]], video observation (Session 2), and shadowing (Session 3)
- Articulate the difference between observing and interpreting
- Identify personal patterns and growth areas in design thinking practice
- Connect individual observation experience to upcoming team work

## Instructions

Write a **400-600 word reflection** addressing the following:

### Part 1: The Observation Experience
- What did you learn about observation from your [[A01-TETHER-Observation|TETHER]] experience and shadowing?
- What was harder than you expected? What was easier?
- How did the different observation modes (video, in-person TETHER, shadowing) reveal different things?

### Part 2: Problems and Assumptions
- What problem or friction did you observe in your environment or during shadowing?
- What assumptions did you make about why the problem exists?
- Looking back, which of those assumptions were actually supported by what you observed vs. what you inferred?

### Part 3: Looking Forward
- What will you carry forward from Project 1 into your team's Project 2 work?
- What do you want to do differently when observing stakeholders for your team's scenario?

## Deliverables

Submit to Canvas before Session 5 (Wednesday, February 4):
- [ ] 400-600 word reflection addressing all three parts
- [ ] Submitted as PDF or Word document

## Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)

This assignment is graded on a **Meets Specifications / Revise** basis.

### Specification 1: Substantive Engagement with Observation Experience

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Reflection includes specific examples from the [[A01-TETHER-Observation|TETHER observation]] and shadowing. Demonstrates genuine reflection on what was learned, not just description of what happened. Addresses challenges and insights with specificity. | Reflection is vague or generic. Lacks specific examples from the actual observation experience. Describes activities without reflecting on learning. Could have been written without completing the observation. |

### Specification 2: Distinction Between Observation and Interpretation

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Clearly articulates the difference between observable facts and inferences/assumptions. Provides specific examples of assumptions made during observation. Shows awareness of which conclusions were supported by evidence vs. inferred. | Conflates observation with interpretation. Does not demonstrate understanding of the distinction. Cannot identify specific assumptions or does not examine whether assumptions were supported by evidence. |

### Specification 3: Forward Application

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Identifies specific, actionable insights to carry into Project 2. Connects individual observation learning to upcoming team-based stakeholder research. Shows intentionality about how to improve or apply learning. | Does not connect Project 1 learning to Project 2. Forward-looking section is vague or missing. No actionable insights identified. |

### Specification 4: Length and Completeness

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Reflection is 400-600 words. All three parts (observation experience, problems/assumptions, looking forward) are addressed. Writing is clear and organized. | Significantly under or over word count. One or more parts are missing or inadequately addressed. Writing is unclear or disorganized. |

**Overall:** Assignment meets specifications when ALL FOUR specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the assignment should be revised and resubmitted.
