<h1>Session 4: Research Synthesis + Problem Definition</h1>

<p><strong>Thursday, March 26, 2026 | 6:30-8:00 PM | Online (Zoom)</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Synthesizing distributed research findings across diverse contexts</li>
  <li>Causal loop analysis: why problems persist</li>
  <li>Crafting a bounded, evidence-based problem definition</li>
  <li>Moving from problem to ideation (rapid idea generation)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We'll Do</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Research Synthesis</strong> (breakout rooms): Share what each team member found during the research period. Identify patterns across contexts, surprises, and contradictions.</li>
  <li><strong>Causal Loop Sharing</strong> (full group): Each team presents their causal loop map (2-3 min). Discuss feedback loops and who benefits from the status quo.</li>
  <li><strong>Problem Definition</strong> (breakout rooms): Finalize your problem statement. It must be bounded, evidence-based, actionable, and not a solution in disguise.</li>
  <li><strong>Peer Critique</strong> (full group): Share problem statements in chat for quick feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Rapid Ideation</strong>: Generate 8-10 solution concepts in 10 minutes. No filtering. Then select 2-3 to develop as testable hypotheses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Bring</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Stakeholder Research document submitted to Canvas before class</li>
  <li>Causal Loop Map submitted to Canvas before class</li>
  <li>Your individual research notes in your notebook</li>
</ul>
