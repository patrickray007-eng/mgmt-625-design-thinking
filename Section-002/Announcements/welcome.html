<p>Welcome to Design Thinking!</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to our work together this semester. This hybrid section has a unique advantage: you'll conduct research in your own diverse environments—workplaces, neighborhoods, cities—bringing richer data to our team projects than any single campus context could provide.</p>

<p><strong>Course Format:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>4 Online Sessions (90 min each) via Zoom</li>
  <li>2 In-Person Sessions (4.5 hours each) in McNair Hall 216</li>
  <li>1 Two-Week Distributed Research Period</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Before our first session (Thursday, February 26, 6:30 PM):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>No preparation required</li>
  <li>Have Zoom ready</li>
  <li>Bring an open mind and willingness to sit with ambiguity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Session 1 (Online):</strong> Thursday, February 26, 6:30-8:00 PM<br>

<p>See you Thursday!</p>

<p>Prof. Ray</p>
