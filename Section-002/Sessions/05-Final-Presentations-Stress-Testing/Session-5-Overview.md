# Session 5: Final Presentations + Stress Testing

**Saturday, April 4, 2026 | 8:00 AM-12:30 PM | In-Person (McNair Hall 216)**

---

## Topics

- Communicating problem-to-solution arcs with traceability to research
- Stress testing assumptions and identifying kill criteria
- Iterating concepts based on peer feedback

## What We'll Do

**Morning (8:00-9:45)**
- Frame the day: "Show your thinking, show your evidence."
- **Final Presentations**: Each team presents (8-10 min) followed by Q&A and stress testing (4-5 min). Focus on problem definition, solution hypotheses, and traceability to distributed research.

**Late Morning (10:00-12:30)**
- Debrief presentations as a group: What made them compelling? Where was traceability strongest?
- **Assumption Audit**: Each team identifies 5 critical assumptions their solution depends on, ranked by importance
- **Kill Criteria**: For your top assumptions, what evidence would disprove them?
- **Stress Test**: Teams pair up for adversarial Q&A. Your goal is to find weaknesses in each other's assumptions, not to agree.
- **Iterate**: Based on stress testing, revise your concept or assumptions. What would you test next?

## What to Bring

- Problem Definition document submitted to Canvas before class
- Your team's presentation (slides optional but recommended)
- Notebook

## Assignments

| Assignment | Status | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| [[A05-Problem-Definition\|Problem Definition]] | **Due before class** | Team document submitted to Canvas before Session 5 |
| [[A06-Final-Presentation\|Final Presentation]] | **Presented this session** | 8-10 min + 4-5 min Q&A and stress testing |
| [[A07-Notebook\|Notebook]] | **Released this session** | Individual: Submit your complete notebook (all entries from TETHER through stress testing). Due before Session 6. |

## Presentation Tips

- Show the journey from research to problem to solution. Traceability is key.
- Use specific evidence: quotes, observations, moments that mattered
- Acknowledge what you don't know and what assumptions you're making
- It's okay to say "we'd need to test that"
- This isn't a polished pitch. It's a demonstration of design thinking in action.

## Ongoing Notebook Practice

**Find the Duct Tape**: Make sure all your weekly entries are captured in your notebook before submitting.

## Looking Ahead

- **Notebook** is due before Session 6 (Thursday, April 9). Submit as PDF (photos/scans for physical notebooks).
- **Session 6** is Thursday, April 9, 6:30-8:00 PM, **online** via Zoom. Reflection and course close.
