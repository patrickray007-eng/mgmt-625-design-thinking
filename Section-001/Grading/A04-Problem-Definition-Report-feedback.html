<p>Good depth of research. Three empathy interviews with detailed accounts and a causal loop with two named reinforcing dynamics make this strongly evidence-based. The problem statement is well-scoped, specific, and the observation about symbolic appreciation vs. practical support (the NBA game insight) is a sharp piece of systems thinking. The conflicts identified in the stakeholder tensions section go further to explain who benefits from the current system remaining broken, which adds real analytical weight.</p>
<p><b>I like</b> the way you used the contrast between Cory&#x27;s relatively smooth transition and others&#x27; struggles to show that the problem is most acute for veterans without financial runway to self-design a decompression period.</p>
<p><b>I wish</b> the solution directions pushed harder on the structural incentives you uncovered. Your analysis shows who benefits from the system staying broken, but the solutions focus on improving existing institutions rather than designing around their misaligned incentives.</p>
<p><b>I wonder</b> what happens if you reframe the &quot;translation&quot; problem as an employer capability gap rather than a veteran deficit. Your evidence supports both framings, and the design implications could be very different.</p>

<p>Strong report. The problem statement is well-bounded and the evidence section draws effectively on both professor and student perspectives. The insight that professors, not students, are the critical stakeholder because they&#x27;re the decision-makers on acting on feedback shows real reframing from your research. The causal loop connecting weak feedback mechanisms to eroding trust and participation is well-constructed. The workaround observations add texture by showing how the system actually functions despite the formal channel&#x27;s weaknesses.</p>
<p><b>I like</b> the reframing that professors hold the decision-making power on whether feedback leads to change, which shifted your focus from improving student input to understanding what makes feedback actionable for the people who act on it.</p>
<p><b>I wish</b> you had explored more deeply why the informal workaround system (professors nudging each other, sharing best practices) works better than the formal channel, since that contrast might point toward more specific solution leverage.</p>
<p><b>I wonder</b> whether the real problem is the evaluation instrument itself or the absence of a visible feedback loop that connects evaluation data back to change students can actually see.</p>

<p>Well-structured report. The consulting onboarding problem is framed precisely, and the reinforcing loops in your causal loop analysis do strong work explaining why the problem persists. The connection to the billable hour model as an unchanging constraint shows good strategic thinking about where solutions can realistically operate. The stakeholder tension table is clean and the identification of managers and firm leadership as the critical behavioral change point is well-reasoned.</p>
<p><b>I like</b> the framing of the billable hour model as the unchanging constraint that any realistic solution must work within rather than try to eliminate.</p>
<p><b>I wish</b> the evidence section included more direct quotes or specific moments from your fieldwork. The structural analysis is strong, but grounding it in a concrete interview moment would make the compression dynamic feel more vivid.</p>
<p><b>I wonder</b> whether the &quot;downloading large information in small time&quot; reframe opens up solution space beyond consulting, since other professions face the same structural mismatch between knowledge volume and available learning time.</p>

<p>Good work grounding this in field observations. The reinforcing loop is clearly articulated and well-supported by your research. The insight about server turnover affecting food recommendations and creating one-time customers is a specific finding that shows your fieldwork surfaced something beyond the obvious. The stakeholder tensions are well-mapped, and the solution directions are practical and clearly tied back to evidence.</p>
<p><b>I like</b> the connection between server turnover and food recommendations as a mechanism that turns first-time visitors into one-time customers. That&#x27;s a specific, non-obvious finding.</p>
<p><b>I wish</b> you had gone deeper into how location visibility and marketing investment interact, since your evidence suggests these compound in ways that might change which solution direction has the most leverage.</p>
<p><b>I wonder</b> whether the reinforcing loop looks different for restaurants that have been open less than two years versus established ones, since the dynamics of the investment-quality-traffic cycle might shift with time.</p>

<h2>Smallbusinesssolutionsengineers</h2>
<p><b>Result: Revise and Resubmit</b></p>
<p>The problem statement is well-scoped and the stakeholder tensions section is solid. The main gap is in the evidence section, which reads more like early-stage brainstorming than research-grounded findings.</p>
<p><b>Specification 2: Evidence Grounding -- Not Met</b></p>
<p>The evidence section identifies stakeholder roles and describes a causal loop, but lacks specific findings that would show the research shaped your understanding. Statements like &quot;Demand is highly variable and difficult to predict&quot; and &quot;Perishable goods create a constant risk trade-off&quot; are reasonable but could have been written before doing any fieldwork. What would make this stronger: a specific quote from a manager about their ordering process, a concrete observation from a cafe visit, or a moment where something you learned surprised you and shifted your framing. The section also notes these are &quot;early observations&quot; and &quot;early stage&quot; analysis, which suggests the research hadn&#x27;t fully landed yet.</p>
<p><b>What to Prioritize if Revising</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Specification 2 (Evidence Grounding)</b>: Go back to your fieldwork and pull in specific evidence: direct quotes from interviews, concrete moments from observations, or specific data points that shaped your understanding. The goal is for a reader to see that your problem definition emerged from research, not assumption. Even 2-3 specific examples woven into the existing structure would make a significant difference.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>I like</b> the problem scoping: perishable inventory management for small coffee shops is specific, bounded, and clearly grounded in a real operational pain point.</p>
<p><b>I wish</b> the evidence section included specific moments from your fieldwork that surprised you or shifted your initial assumptions. The structure is there, but it needs the concrete details that show the research shaped the framing.</p>
<p><b>I wonder</b> what a manager&#x27;s actual ordering decision looks like first thing in the morning: what information do they use, what do they wish they had, and where exactly does the process break down? Getting granular on that moment could sharpen both the problem definition and the solution directions.</p>

<p>Good work with a complex, real-world operations problem. The framing around interacting feedback loops clearly explains why delivery instability persists. The stakeholder mapping revealing different time horizons is sharp and drives the tension analysis well. The solution directions are tightly connected to specific dynamics from your analysis.</p>
<p><b>I like</b> the insight that different stakeholders operate on fundamentally different time horizons, which creates misalignment that no single party can resolve alone.</p>
<p><b>I wish</b> you had included more direct observations from the production floor or specific examples of how the fast reinforcing loops overpower the slower stabilizing efforts in practice.</p>
<p><b>I wonder</b> what the minimum viable governance checkpoint would look like: how light could commercial gatekeeping be while still protecting operations from premature commitments?</p>

<p>Strong research depth. Fieldwork across multiple QSR locations with direct quotes from managers and employees gives this a strong evidentiary foundation. The causal analysis is well-constructed, and the insight that the employee silence loop sabotages the feedback assessment loop is a sophisticated piece of systems thinking. The stakeholder tensions are each grounded in specific real-world evidence, which keeps them from feeling padded. The concrete observable behaviors throughout show strong application of the framework.</p>
<p><b>I like</b> the insight that the silence loop structurally sabotages the feedback assessment loop, making the organization&#x27;s formal learning mechanism unreliable at the systems level.</p>
<p><b>I wish</b> you had explored whether any of the three locations had attempted to address this dynamic before and what happened, since understanding failed interventions could sharpen your solution directions.</p>
<p><b>I wonder</b> whether the &quot;You Said...We Did&quot; board concept could be tested quickly in a real location to validate whether visible loop-closing actually changes customer feedback behavior.</p>
