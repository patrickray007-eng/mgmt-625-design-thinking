<h1>Session 3: Stakeholder Mapping + Research Planning</h1>

<p><strong>Thursday, March 12, 2026 | 6:30-8:00 PM | Online (Zoom)</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Identifying and mapping stakeholders for your team's scenario</li>
  <li>Extreme users and overlooked perspectives</li>
  <li>The transition from observation to empathy interviews</li>
  <li>Planning distributed research that leverages your team's combined reach</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We'll Do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Quick team check-ins: Has your thinking shifted since Session 2?</li>
  <li><strong>Stakeholder Mapping</strong> (breakout rooms): Identify 4-5 stakeholders for your scenario, including at least one extreme user. For each, map what they optimize for, what constrains them, and which team member can access them.</li>
  <li>Full-group debrief: Share one stakeholder your team almost forgot</li>
  <li><strong>Research Planning</strong> (breakout rooms): Design your team's two-week research plan. Who can each member reach? What will each person do (observation, interview, or both)? How will you coordinate and compile findings?</li>
  <li>Close: Share research plans and confirm deliverables</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Bring</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Problem Reflection submitted to Canvas before class</li>
  <li>Notebook</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Research Period (March 12-26)</h2>

<p>After this session, your team has <strong>two weeks of distributed fieldwork</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each team member conducts 1-2 substantial observations or interviews in their own context</li>
  <li>Focus on depth, not breadth</li>
  <li>Document in your notebook; contribute to your team's shared document</li>
  <li>Coordinate with your team asynchronously</li>
  <li>Compile findings before Session 4</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ongoing Notebook Practice</h2>

<p><strong>Find the Duct Tape</strong>: Document one workaround or improvised fix you encountered this week.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stakeholder Research</strong> and <strong>Causal Loop Map</strong> are both due Session 4 (Thursday, March 26)</li>
  <li><strong>Session 4</strong> is Thursday, March 26, 6:30-8:00 PM, <strong>online</strong> via Zoom</li>
  <li>Use the two-week gap to conduct research in your own environments</li>
</ul>
