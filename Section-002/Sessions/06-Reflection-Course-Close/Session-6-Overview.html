  <li>Which of the 7 design abilities felt most natural to you? Which was most challenging?</li>
  <li>Where in your professional context do you jump to solutions too quickly?</li>
  <li>Think about your TETHER observation. What would you notice differently now?</li>
  <li>What did you learn from your teammates' diverse contexts that you couldn't have learned alone?</li>
  <li>What's one specific practice from this course you'll carry into your work?</li>
  <li>Look back at your Find the Duct Tape entries. What patterns do you see?</li>
