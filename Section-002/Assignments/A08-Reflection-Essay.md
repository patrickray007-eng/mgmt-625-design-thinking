# Reflection Essay

## Assignment Overview

This reflection closes the course by examining your design thinking learning and how you'll apply it in your professional context. You'll consider which design abilities resonated, where you tend to jump to solutions, and how distributed research across diverse environments enriched your team's work.

## Learning Objectives

- Reflect on personal growth across the 7 design abilities
- Connect design thinking practices to professional contexts
- Evaluate how distributed research and diverse team contexts strengthened problem understanding
- Articulate transferable skills from the course

## Instructions

Write a **500-800 word reflection** addressing the following:

### Part 1: Design Abilities
- Which of the 7 design abilities felt most natural to you? Most challenging?
- What specific moment or activity during the course shifted your thinking about one of these abilities?

### Part 2: Professional Application
- Where in your professional context do you jump to solutions too quickly?
- How might you apply "Navigate Ambiguity" or "Learn From Others" in your work?
- How might you use observation or stakeholder mapping in your professional role?

### Part 3: The Value of Diverse Contexts
- What did you learn from your teammates' diverse contexts during the distributed research period?
- How did having team members in different industries, cities, or environments enrich your understanding of the problem?
- What would have been different if everyone had researched in the same location?

## Deliverables

Submit to Canvas before Session 6 (Thursday, April 9):
- [ ] 500-800 word reflection addressing all three parts
- [ ] Submitted as PDF or Word document

## Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)

This assignment is graded on a **Meets Specifications / Revise** basis.

### Specification 1: Design Ability Reflection

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Identifies specific design abilities that felt natural and challenging with concrete examples from the course. Demonstrates genuine self-awareness about personal strengths and growth areas. References specific moments or activities. | Vague or generic statements about design abilities. Cannot identify specific examples from course activities. Lists abilities without reflecting on personal experience with them. |

### Specification 2: Professional Application

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Provides concrete examples of where design thinking practices could be applied in their professional context. Identifies specific situations where they tend to jump to solutions. Shows intentionality about applying observation or stakeholder mapping at work. | Professional application is vague or hypothetical. Cannot identify specific situations in their work context. Generic statements that could apply to anyone. |

### Specification 3: Distributed Research Reflection

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Reflects on what was specifically learned from teammates' different contexts. Articulates how diverse environments enriched the team's understanding. Shows appreciation for perspectives that differed from their own. | Does not address the value of distributed research. Missing or superficial reflection on teammates' contexts. Cannot identify what was learned from diversity of environments. |

### Specification 4: Depth and Specificity

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Reflection goes beyond surface-level observations. Includes specific details, examples, and moments from the course. Writing demonstrates genuine thinking, not formulaic responses. Shows evidence of synthesis across the full course arc. | Reflection stays at surface level. Lacks specific details or examples. Reads as formulaic or generic. Does not demonstrate synthesis across the course experience. |

### Specification 5: Length and Completeness

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Reflection is 500-800 words. All three parts (design abilities, professional application, distributed research) are addressed. Writing is clear and organized. | Significantly under or over word count. One or more parts are missing or inadequately addressed. Writing is unclear or disorganized. |
