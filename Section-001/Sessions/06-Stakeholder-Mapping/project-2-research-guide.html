<h1>Project 2 Research Guide</h1>

<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>Between now and Session 8 (February 16), each team member should conduct <strong>1-2 research activities</strong>: observations, interviews, or both. You're building the evidence base for your problem definition and causal loop map.</p>

<p>This is not optional. When your team presents, we will ask: "What did you learn from talking to people?" Your problem definition should be grounded in real conversations, not assumptions.</p>

<h2>Two Research Tools</h2>

<p>In Project 1, you practiced <strong>observation</strong>: watching without interpreting, documenting what you see. That skill still matters. Keep using it.</p>

<p>In Project 2, you add a second tool: <strong>the empathy interview</strong>. You've mapped your stakeholders on paper. Now you need to learn from them directly.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Observation</td>
      <td>What people <em>do</em>: behaviors, patterns, workarounds</td>
      <td>When you can watch the problem in action</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interview</td>
      <td>Why people do it: motivations, constraints, frustrations</td>
      <td>When you need to understand someone's perspective</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Use both. Observation shows you the surface. Interviews show you what's underneath.</p>

<h2>Empathy Interview Principles</h2>

<p>These five principles will guide your conversations:</p>

<h3>1. Listen more than you talk.</h3>

<p>Your job is to understand their world, not explain yours. Aim for an 80/20 split: they should be talking 80% of the time. If you find yourself explaining your project or offering solutions, stop and ask another question.</p>

<h3>2. Follow curiosity.</h3>

<p>When something surprises you, go deeper. The most interesting insights come from moments you didn't expect. Your best follow-up question is often: "Tell me more about that."</p>

<h3>3. Ask for stories, not opinions.</h3>

<p>"Tell me about a time when..." is almost always better than "What do you think about..." Stories give you concrete details, emotions, and context. Opinions give you generalizations.</p>

<h3>4. Embrace silence.</h3>

<p>After they answer, resist the urge to immediately ask another question. Wait a few seconds. People often fill the silence with something more honest or more interesting than their initial response.</p>

<h3>5. No leading questions.</h3>

<p>"What's frustrating about X?" assumes X is frustrating. Try: "How do you experience X?" Let them tell you what matters, rather than confirming what you already believe.</p>

<h2>Good Questions vs. Bad Questions</h2>

<h2>Setting Up an Interview</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Identify who to talk to.</strong> Start with your stakeholder map. Who can you actually reach? Prioritize stakeholders you know least about.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for 20-30 minutes.</strong> Keep it manageable. You can always go longer if the conversation is productive.</li>
  <li><strong>Explain briefly.</strong> "I'm working on a class project about [topic]. I'd love to hear about your experience. No preparation needed."</li>
  <li><strong>Take notes by hand if possible.</strong> It slows you down in a good way. If you want to record, always ask permission first.</li>
  <li><strong>Go where they are.</strong> If you can interview someone in their work environment, you'll learn more than in a conference room or over Zoom.</li>
</ol>

<h2>During the Interview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Start with easy, warm-up questions ("How long have you been in this role?")</li>
  <li>Move toward the topic gradually</li>
  <li>When something surprises you, follow it</li>
  <li>Write down direct quotes when you can</li>
  <li>Note body language, hesitations, and energy shifts</li>
  <li>End with: "Is there anything I should have asked that I didn't?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>After the Interview</h2>

<p>Within 24 hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Write up your notes</strong> while the conversation is fresh</li>
  <li><strong>Highlight 2-3 key insights</strong>: what did you learn that you didn't know before?</li>
  <li><strong>Flag surprises</strong>: what contradicted your assumptions?</li>
  <li><strong>Share with your team</strong>: your findings are team resources</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combining Observation and Interviews</h2>

<p>The strongest research uses both tools together. Consider this sequence:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Observe first.</strong> Watch the environment or process before talking to anyone.</li>
  <li><strong>Interview based on what you saw.</strong> "I noticed that [observation]. Can you help me understand what's happening there?"</li>
  <li><strong>Observe again.</strong> After the interview, go back and watch with new understanding.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your observations give you questions. Your interviews give you answers. Then your observations give you better questions.</p>

<h2>The Research Expectation</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Each team member</strong>: 1-2 research activities before Session 8 (February 16)</li>
  <li>Activities can be observations, interviews, or both</li>
  <li>Document everything in your notebook</li>
  <li>Share findings with your team before Session 8</li>
  <li>Your Causal Loop Map (due Session 8) should reflect what you learned from real people</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Your Team</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Divide stakeholders.</strong> Don't all interview the same person. Each member should target a different stakeholder or context.</li>
  <li><strong>Share as you go.</strong> Don't wait until Session 8 to compare notes. Quick updates keep everyone aligned.</li>
  <li><strong>Capture direct quotes.</strong> Exact words from real people are more powerful than your summary of what they said.</li>
  <li><strong>Track your assumptions.</strong> Before each interview, write down what you expect to hear. Afterward, note what actually happened. The gaps are where the insight lives.</li>
</ul>
