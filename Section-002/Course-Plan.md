> [!abstract]- Course Overview
>
> ## The 7 Design Abilities
>
> This course develops the Stanford d.school's Design Abilities—underlying capabilities learners can apply in any problem space.
>
> 1. **Navigate Ambiguity** — Persist in the discomfort of not knowing; develop tactics to overcome ambiguity.
> 2. **Learn From Others** — Empathize with diverse viewpoints; observe and learn from unfamiliar contexts.
> 3. **Synthesize Information** — Make sense of information and find insight within.
> 4. **Experiment Rapidly** — Quickly generate ideas—written, drawn, or built.
> 5. **Move Between Concrete and Abstract** — Zoom in and out between details and big picture.
> 6. **Build and Craft Intentionally** — Show work at appropriate resolution for feedback desired.
> 7. **Communicate Deliberately** — Form and relate stories, ideas, and learnings to audiences.
>
> ## Course Structure
>
> ### Hybrid Format Advantage
> This section leverages the hybrid format as a pedagogical strength. Students observe and research in their own diverse environments—workplaces, neighborhoods, cities—bringing richer, more varied data to team projects than a single campus context could provide.
>
> ### Two Projects
> - **Project 1** (Sessions 1-2): Individual observation in student's own environment.
> - **Project 2** (Sessions 2-6): Teams of 5, business/nonprofit scenario through full design cycle.
>
> ### Three Phases
> - **Phase 1** — Empathy and Observation (Sessions 1-2): Building observational discipline.
> - **Phase 2** — Problem Definition (Sessions 3-4 + research gap): Framing, reframing, articulating problems.
> - **Phase 3** — Ideation and Testing (Sessions 5-6): Generating solutions, presenting, and reflecting.

> [!note]- Pedagogical Approach
>
> ## Inquiry-Based Learning
>
> This course uses an **Explore → Make Sense → Name** pattern:
> - **Explore:** Learners dive into activities without full scaffolding.
> - **Make Sense:** Surface discoveries, struggles, and patterns collectively.
> - **Name:** Introduce vocabulary and frameworks after experience.
>
> ## The Notebook
>
> Each learner maintains a design thinking notebook (physical or digital). Contains: Find the Duct Tape entries (weekly), TETHER observations, stakeholder maps, causal loops, and reflections. Submitted digitally at course end; graded on completion.
>
> ## Distributed Research as Strength
>
> The two-week research gap (Mar 12-26) is intentional. Teams leverage members' diverse environments—different workplaces, industries, geographic contexts—to gather richer stakeholder data than any single location could provide.
>
> ## Asynchronous + Synchronous Balance
>
> Online sessions focus on framing, synthesis, and team coordination. In-person sessions carry hands-on activities, team formation, and presentations. Fieldwork happens asynchronously in students' own contexts.

> [!tip]- Grading Framework
>
> Specifications-based grading. Credit awarded based on the number of specifications met. Manageable without a TA.
>
> | Component | Weight | Notes |
> |-----------|--------|-------|
> | Attendance & Participation | 25% | Present, on time, engaged in activities and discussions |
> | Individual Assignments | 35% | Notebook (includes TETHER, Find the Duct Tape), Problem Reflection |
> | Team Assignments | 40% | Stakeholder Research, Causal Loop Map, Problem Definition, Final Presentation |
>
> *Source: Syllabus distributed to students. The exact mix of assignments may be adjusted based on class needs.*
>
> ## Token System
>
> 6 tokens per learner: 3 for 24-hour extensions, 3 for revisions. Teams receive 3 revision tokens collectively.
>
> ## Group Formation
>
> Project 1: Individual. Project 2: Teams of ~5, formed Session 2 by scenario selection.

> [!abstract]- Project 2: Bird's Eye View
>
> ### The Arc
>
> Project 2 is a team design challenge that runs Sessions 2-6. The hybrid format means your team's diverse contexts become a research advantage.
>
> - **Session 2: Launch** -- Form your team, select a scenario, and begin initial exploration. Map what each team member can access.
> - **Session 3: Research Planning** -- Stakeholder mapping and distributed research design. Divide research responsibilities based on who can reach which stakeholders.
> - **Research Gap (2 weeks)** -- Distributed field research across team members' contexts. Each member conducts observations and interviews in their own environment.
> - **Session 4: Define + Synthesize** -- Compile research from diverse contexts, build a causal loop map, define the problem, and begin ideation.
> - **Session 5: Communicate + Test** -- Final presentations with stress testing. Show the full arc from problem to solution.
> - **Session 6: Reflect** -- Individual and collective reflection on the design process.
>
> ### Design Abilities by Phase
>
> Navigate Ambiguity runs throughout the entire project. The other abilities come into focus at different stages:
>
> | Phase | Sessions | Primary Abilities |
> |-------|----------|-------------------|
> | Understand | 2-3 + Research Gap | Learn From Others, Synthesize Information |
> | Define | 4 | Synthesize Information, Move Between Concrete and Abstract |
> | Ideate + Test | 4-5 | Experiment Rapidly, Build and Craft Intentionally |
> | Communicate | 5 | Communicate Deliberately, Build and Craft Intentionally |
> | Reflect | 6 | All abilities through reflection |
>
> ### Choosing Your Subject
>
> A **scenario** is a broad problem space. A **subject** is your team's specific investigation within it.
>
> **Examples:**
> - Scenario A (First 90 Days) + Subject: "How do new nurses navigate their first rotation at a community hospital?"
> - Scenario D (Access Barriers) + Subject: "Why do eligible families in one school district not use the free tutoring program?"
> - Scenario B (Small Business Friction) + Subject: "What operational workarounds do independent coffee shop owners rely on daily?"
>
> **How to choose well:**
> - Pick a subject where your team can access real stakeholders (you need to observe and talk to people, not just read about them)
> - Keep it bounded: one organization, one location, or one population
> - Follow genuine curiosity, not what seems "important"
> - Aim for no more than 3 stakeholder groups
>
> **The hybrid advantage:** Your team members work in different industries, live in different cities, and move through different communities. That combined reach is your research superpower. Choose a subject where your team's diverse contexts give you access to different facets of the problem.

> [!example]- Project 2 Scenarios
>
> Teams select one scenario. Each provides a problem space with room to choose a specific subject. The hybrid format allows teams to gather data from members' diverse professional and geographic contexts.
>
> ### Business Scenarios
>
> **A: The First 90 Days**
> *How do new employees learn to navigate an organization?*
> Choose an organization type and explore the new employee experience. What isn't taught? Who helps? What falls through the cracks?
>
> **B: Small Business Friction**
> *What makes running a small business harder than it needs to be?*
> Choose a small business type and explore operational friction. What systems don't work together? What workarounds exist?
>
> **C: The Feedback Gap**
> *How do organizations learn what's not working?*
> Explore how feedback flows—or doesn't—between customers, frontline staff, and decision-makers.
>
> ### Nonprofit / Social Impact Scenarios
>
> **D: Access Barriers**
> *Why can't people access services designed for them?*
> Choose a service type and explore what prevents access. What constraints does each stakeholder group face?
>
> **E: The Volunteer Experience**
> *What makes volunteering sustainable—or not?*
> Explore why volunteers stay or leave. What tensions exist between volunteers, staff, and those served?
>
> **F: Mission vs. Operations**
> *How do mission-driven organizations navigate competing pressures?*
> Explore tensions between mission impact and operational sustainability. What trade-offs get made?

> [!warning]- Assignments Overview
>
> ## Individual Assignments
>
> **Notebook (Submitted Session 6)**
> Contains all practice work, including TETHER observation. Graded on completion and sustained engagement.
>
> **TETHER (Due Session 2)**
> 90-minute uninterrupted observation in your own environment. 2-3 pages raw observation + half-page reflection. Done asynchronously before Session 2. Graded as part of the Notebook.
>

> 400-600 word reflection on Project 1 observation experience.
>
> **Reflection Essay (Due Session 6) — 5%**
> 500-800 word reflection on design thinking learning and professional application. Which abilities felt natural, where you jump to solutions, how you'll use observation and stakeholder mapping at work.
>
> ## Team Assignments
>
> **Stakeholder Research (Due Session 4) — 10%**
> Each team member conducts observation/interviews in their own context. Compiled team document synthesizing findings.
>
> **Causal Loop Map (Due Session 4) — 5%**

## Phase 1: Empathy and Observation

> [!note]- Session 1: Course Intro + Navigate Ambiguity
>
> **Thursday, February 26, 2026 | 6:30-8:00 PM | Online (Zoom)**
>
> **Primary Design Abilities:** Navigate Ambiguity
>
> ### Learning Objectives
>
> By the end of this session, learners will be able to:
> - Understand the three-phase structure of the design thinking process
> - Experience ambiguity as a productive state rather than a problem to solve
> - Articulate the value of observation in diverse environments
> - Prepare for TETHER observation in their own context
>
> ### Session Schedule
>
> | Time | Min | Activity |
> |------|-----|----------|
> | 6:30 | 10 | OPENING: Welcome. Brief introductions in chat (name, location, one word for how you feel about ambiguity). Frame the hybrid format as an advantage. |
> | 6:40 | 15 | FRAME: Course overview. Three phases. 7 design abilities (mention without explaining). Hybrid structure: your diverse environments are assets. |
> | 6:55 | 20 | EXPLORE: Video Ambiguity Exercise. Three curated videos with no context. Watch, write, sit with not-knowing. Chat drops between clips. |
> | 7:15 | 15 | MAKE SENSE: Full-group debrief. What did you not know? When did you start making up stories? What was uncomfortable about watching without context? |
> | 7:30 | 10 | NAME: "What you just experienced is Navigate Ambiguity." First of 7 abilities. Preview how this applies throughout the course. |
> | 7:40 | 15 | CLOSE: Introduce TETHER assignment. Key point: you'll observe in YOUR environment (workplace, coffee shop, commute, neighborhood). Your context is the asset. Explain what to document. Introduce Find the Duct Tape: a weekly notebook practice. Each week, identify one "duct tape" solution you encounter, a workaround or improvised fix people use to deal with a broken process. Document it in your notebook. |
> | 7:55 | 5 | Wrap-up: Questions. Confirm Session 2 logistics (in-person, Saturday, 4.5 hours). |
>
> ### Video Ambiguity Exercise
>
> **Format:** Condensed video sequence shown via screen share. No context given—students don't know what they're watching or why. Notebooks out, write as you watch.
>
> **Video Sequence (~12 min):**
>
> | # | Video | Duration | Why It Creates Ambiguity |
> |---|-------|----------|--------------------------|
> | 1 | NYC 1910s | ~4 min (excerpt) | Unfamiliar era. Students must observe without modern reference points. What are the rules of this world? |
> | 2 | Tokyo Shibuya (Rambalac) | ~3 min (excerpt) | Sensory overload. Too much to process. What do you filter? What do you miss? |
> | 3 | Stainless: Dadar (Adam Magyar) | ~2 min | No framing. Just "watch." Slow-motion footage at 1/54th speed. Disorienting, intimate, unresolvable. |
>
> **Facilitation Notes:**
> - Before Video 1: "I'm going to show you three short videos. Your only job is to watch and write. No other instructions."
> - Between videos: "Drop one word in chat for what you just experienced." (10-15 seconds of silence before the next clip.)
> - After Video 3: 2 minutes of silent writing. Then debrief.
> - Do NOT explain Magyar until after the debrief. Let students sit with not-knowing.
>
> **Debrief Prompts (MAKE SENSE, 15 min):**
> - "What did you not know while watching?"
> - "When did you start making up stories or explanations?"
> - "What was it like to keep watching without understanding?"
> - "Did your strategy change from video 1 to video 3?"
> - "Where did certainty creep in—and was it real?"
>
> **Bridge to NAME:** "What you just practiced is Navigate Ambiguity. Sitting with incomplete information and resisting the urge to resolve it prematurely. That's the first design ability, and it's the hardest one."
>

>
> ### Setup
> - Choose a location in your own environment where you can observe for 90 uninterrupted minutes
> - Good options: workplace common area, local coffee shop, grocery store, transit station, park
> - Arrive with notebook and pen only—no laptop, phone on silent and away
>
> ### During Observation
> - Document what you see, not what you think it means
> - Note: movements, pauses, interactions, objects used, spaces occupied
> - Resist the urge to interpret or solve
> - When you catch yourself making assumptions, note them separately

> ### After Observation
> - Write a half-page reflection: What was hard? What did you notice about your own attention? What surprised you?
>
> ### The Hybrid Advantage
> Your observation location is unique to you. The diversity of contexts across the class creates richer collective data than any single campus location could provide.

> | Ability | What It Looks Like | Where It Shows Up |
> |---------|-------------------|-------------------|
> | Navigate Ambiguity | Staying in the question; resisting premature closure | Session 1, TETHER, research period |
> | Learn From Others | Observing without judgment; seeking extreme users | TETHER, stakeholder research, team contexts |
> | Synthesize Information | Finding patterns; moving from data to insight | Session 4 synthesis, problem definition |
> | Experiment Rapidly | Generating many ideas; building to think | Ideation, stress testing |
> | Move Concrete/Abstract | Zooming in/out; connecting details to purpose | Stakeholder mapping, causal loops |
> | Build Intentionally | Right resolution for feedback needed | Presentations, prototypes |
> | Communicate Deliberately | Telling the story of your thinking | Final presentation, reflection |

> [!quote]- Appendix C: Distributed Research Guidelines
>
> ### Why Distributed Research?
> In a hybrid course, team members access different workplaces, industries, cities, and communities. This geographic and professional diversity is a research asset.
>
> ### Planning Your Team's Research
> 1. Map your combined reach: What contexts can each member access?
> 2. Identify which stakeholders each member can observe or interview
> 3. Divide research responsibilities to maximize coverage
> 4. Coordinate via async channels between Sessions 3 and 4
>
> ### Quality Over Quantity
> - Each member: 1-2 substantial observations or interviews
> - Focus on depth, not breadth
> - Document in notebook; compile for team
>
> ### Synthesis
> - Before Session 4: Share findings in team document
> - Look for patterns across contexts
> - Note where different contexts revealed different facets of the problem
