<h1>TETHER Guide for Hybrid Format</h1>

<h2>Your Environment is the Asset</h2>

<p>In this hybrid course, you'll observe in your own context rather than a shared campus location. This means our class will have observations from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different workplaces and industries</li>
  <li>Different cities and neighborhoods</li>
  <li>Different types of public spaces</li>
  <li>Different times of day and week</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing Your Location</h2>

<p>Pick somewhere you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Observe for 90 uninterrupted minutes</li>
  <li>See people interacting with spaces, systems, or each other</li>
  <li>Sit or stand comfortably without being disruptive</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Good options:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Your workplace common area, lobby, or break room</li>
  <li>A local coffee shop during busy hours</li>
  <li>Public transit (station or during a commute)</li>
  <li>Grocery store or retail environment</li>
  <li>Community space, library, or park</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Makes Your Context Valuable</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You have insider access others don't</li>
  <li>You understand background context</li>
  <li>You can notice things an outsider would miss</li>
  <li>Your observations complement others' different contexts</li>
</ul>
