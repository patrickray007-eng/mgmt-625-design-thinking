# TETHER Observation

## Assignment Overview

TETHER stands for **T**ake **E**xtended **T**ime to **H**old **E**verything in **R**eview. This assignment develops your capacity to observe without immediately interpreting or solving, a foundational design thinking skill.

You will spend 90 uninterrupted minutes observing in an environment of your choosing. Unlike traditional campus-based fieldwork, you'll observe in your own context: your workplace, a local coffee shop, public transit, a grocery store, or another location where you can watch people interact with systems, spaces, and each other.

This distributed approach is intentional. Your unique vantage point contributes to our collective understanding when we share observations in class.

## Learning Objectives

- Practice sustained observation without interpretation
- Develop awareness of your own assumptions and attention patterns
- Document observable behaviors, movements, and interactions
- Reflect on the experience of observing

## Instructions

### Before Your Observation

1. **Choose your location.** Select a place in your own environment where:
   - You can observe for 90 uninterrupted minutes
   - People interact with systems, spaces, or each other
   - You can sit or stand comfortably without drawing attention
   - Good options: workplace common area, coffee shop, grocery store, transit station, park, library

2. **Prepare your materials.** Bring only:
   - Your notebook
   - A pen
   - Phone on silent and put away (not for reference)

### During Your Observation (90 minutes)

1. **Document what you see, not what you think it means.**
   - Movements: Where do people go? How do they move through space?
   - Pauses: Where do people stop? What makes them hesitate?
   - Interactions: How do people engage with each other? With objects? With the environment?
   - Objects: What do people carry, use, touch, ignore?
   - Spaces: How is the space organized? Where do people cluster or avoid?

2. **Resist the urge to interpret or solve.**
   - Write "Person looked at phone, then looked around, then walked to counter"
   - NOT "Person was confused about where to go"

3. **Note your assumptions separately.**
   - When you catch yourself making an assumption, write it in the margin
   - Example: "I assumed she was waiting for someone, but I don't actually know that"

4. **Stay for the full 90 minutes.**
   - The discipline of extended observation reveals patterns that shorter observations miss

### After Your Observation

Write a **half-page reflection** (approximately 250 words) addressing:
- What was difficult about observing without interpreting?
- What did you notice about your own attention? Where did it drift?
- What surprised you about what you observed?
- What might you do differently next time?

## Deliverables

Bring to Session 4 (Monday, February 2):
- [ ] Notebook with 90 minutes of raw observations
- [ ] Assumptions noted separately in margins
- [ ] Half-page written reflection

## Grading

This assignment is graded as part of your **Notebook** grade. Your TETHER observation will be collected with your notebook at Session 12. Credit is awarded based on the number of specifications met.

### Specifications

**1. Observation Duration and Depth**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Observations clearly reflect 90 minutes of sustained attention. Notes span at least 3-4 pages and include multiple types of observations (movements, interactions, objects, spaces). Timestamps or time markers indicate sustained engagement throughout the observation period. | Observations appear rushed or superficial. Notes are sparse (fewer than 2 pages) or repetitive. No evidence of sustained attention over the full 90 minutes. Observations cluster around a single moment rather than spanning the full period. |

**2. Descriptive vs. Interpretive**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Observations focus on observable behaviors and facts. Language describes what happened without inferring motivation, emotion, or meaning. When interpretations appear, they are flagged as assumptions. Example: "Woman checked watch three times in two minutes" rather than "Woman was impatient." | Observations are primarily interpretive or judgmental. Notes assume motivations, emotions, or intentions without observable evidence. Assumptions are presented as facts. Example: "Rude customer ignored the barista" rather than describing the observable behavior. |

**3. Assumption Awareness**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Margins or separate section includes at least 3-5 assumptions the observer caught themselves making. Assumptions are specific and connected to observations. Demonstrates metacognitive awareness of the observer's own biases and inferences. | No assumptions identified, or assumptions are vague/generic. No evidence of reflection on the observer's own interpretive tendencies. Observer appears unaware of the difference between observation and inference. |

**4. Reflection Quality**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Reflection is approximately 250 words and addresses all prompts: difficulty of observing without interpreting, attention patterns, surprises, and future adjustments. Shows genuine engagement with the experience and specific examples from the observation. | Reflection is missing, significantly under length, or superficial. Does not address the prompts or provides only generic responses without specific examples. Does not demonstrate learning from the experience. |
