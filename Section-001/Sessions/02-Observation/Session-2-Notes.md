## Quick recap

The class session focused on developing observation skills through video analysis of urban environments, with students instructed to watch and note changes across different cities and time periods. Due to weather conditions, the session was conducted remotely with activities including video observation exercises and discussions about cultural differences and social behaviors. The class also covered an upcoming shadowing assignment and discussed the "tether" observation exercise, with students receiving guidance on finding suitable observation locations and participants.

## Next steps

- All students: Find and arrange to observe a person at work (shadowing assignment) for 30 minutes during the class session on Wednesday 2:30-3:00, and email the instructor confirmation of the arrangement.
- Students who have not yet found someone to observe: Contact the instructor by end of day if unable to find someone, so the instructor can help identify potential people to shadow.
- Students who cannot attend Wednesday's class session (e.g., Mayur): Email the instructor to request use of a token for a 24-hour extension and arrange to complete the shadowing assignment at another time, then submit deliverables by the new deadline.
- Tushar: Email the instructor to request submission of the "find the duct tape" assignment by tomorrow noon and provide explanation.
- All students: Complete the 90-minute uninterrupted observation assignment in one location, submit written notes and a half-page written reflection by session 4 (next week).
- Students who wish to use a physical notebook for the 90-minute observation: Pick up a notebook from the instructor in class on Wednesday.
- Students who have arranged to shadow someone: Email the instructor a confirmation or screenshot of the arrangement.
- Rishi: Email the instructor to request an extension for the shadowing assignment.

## Summary

### Session Reconfiguration and Observation Timing

Patrick discussed the reconfiguration needed for the session due to weather conditions and mentioned observing students in various campus locations. He corrected the timing for the observation session, suggesting a change to 2:30 to 3:00, and received majority approval from the participants. Patrick encouraged everyone to observe students in their work environments and provided examples of potential observation sites.

### Urban Observation Skills Training Session

Patrick led a remote class session focused on observation skills, replacing an in-person campus activity due to weather conditions. He explained that students should maximize their screen space and take notes by hand while watching videos of various urban settings, including Central Park, London, Tokyo, Shibuya Station, and Mumbai, to identify changes and patterns over time. Patrick emphasized the importance of making observations rather than interpretations, defining observations as simple statements of fact and interpretations as speculative explanations. The session aimed to practice these skills through video content, with students scheduled to share their observations during a debrief.

### Urban Video Analysis Discussion

Patrick led a discussion about observing and analyzing videos of urban environments, specifically focusing on a sequence in Shibuya, Tokyo. He instructed the group to watch a 2-minute video slowed to 1/54th speed and to note their observations. After the video, participants shared their observations in the chat, which included topics like movement, seasons, personal space, modes of transport, organization, and cultural differences. Patrick encouraged the group to continue analyzing the videos and reconvene to discuss their findings further.

### Cultural Observations from Video Series

The class discussed observations from a video series showing different locations and time periods. Students noted various cultural differences, such as personal space and clothing styles, across different cities and historical periods. Patrick shared his own experiences visiting some of the locations and mentioned specific details he noticed, including infrastructure and seasonal changes in Central Park. The class also discussed how their attention levels changed over time while watching the videos, with Rishi noting a decrease in detailed observations as the video progressed.

### Comparing City Crowds Over Time

The group discussed observations from historical and modern footage of crowded city scenes, particularly comparing Shibuya and London. Ben noted differences in posture and walking pace between historical and modern footage, while Tushar observed how people in Shibuya took up more space compared to London. Dyan mentioned that people in Shibuya appeared more excited to take photos, while London had more people using umbrellas and faster-moving men in hoodies. Joy and Justin highlighted details revealed by slowing down footage, such as people's focused expressions and a man struggling with a heavy bag. Olivia observed men carrying loads, juice signs, and a mix of people from different religions, with few smiles visible.

### Observations in Historical and Modern Videos

The team discussed observations from historical and modern city videos, noting changes in fashion, technology, and social behavior across different locations. They observed that people in older videos often looked directly at the camera, while modern videos showed less awareness of the camera, and that billboards became more prevalent in recent years. The group also discussed how prompts influenced their observation focus, with Joy noting that she initially focused on environmental and weather changes before moving to other observations. Patrick led a discussion about how people's attention is drawn to different elements in videos, and how their observation skills can be directed by understanding their natural focus points.

### Observing NYC's Changing Interactions

The group discussed their observations of historical and modern New York City videos, focusing on how people's interactions with their environment changed over time. They noticed differences in clothing, mannerisms, and behavior between the 1910s and present-day New York. The participants shared their personal observation strategies, with some focusing on people's movements and patterns, while others noticed the lack of landscape references in their notes. Patrick encouraged the group to reflect on when they started making assumptions about people's motivations and feelings based on their behavior and appearance.

### Observation Strategies for Design Context

The group discussed their observation strategies while watching videos of different cities. Zeynep and Tushar described developing systems to notice changes in people's interactions and movements across different contexts. Patrick introduced the AEIOU framework (Activities, Environment, Interactions, Objects, Users) as a tool for more comprehensive observation, particularly when designing for human users. He noted that with AI's emergence, designers now need to consider non-human stakeholders as well. The discussion highlighted the importance of context in observation strategies and the need to be mindful of all elements in the AEIOU framework when conducting design observations.

### Enhancing Observational Skills Through Tether

Patrick discussed the impact of prompts on design thinking and observation, explaining how prompts influence behavior and noticing patterns after being prompted. He emphasized that the order of video presentations influenced observations, allowing for comparisons and new insights. Patrick then introduced an assignment called the "tether," which involves 90 minutes of uninterrupted observation in an environment, focusing on people's movements, hesitations, and interactions without immediate interpretation or solving. He provided suggestions for observation locations, such as campus areas, coffee shops, parks, grocery stores, transit stations, and libraries, and clarified that the assignment is meant to be monotonous to build observational skills.

### Observation Assignment Guidelines

The class discussed an upcoming observation assignment where students will spend 90 minutes at a single location, such as a park or coffee shop, to observe people and their interactions. Patrick explained that after making factual observations, students should write a half-page reflection focusing on how they noticed things rather than just what they noticed, including their thought process and any interpretations. Several students asked clarifying questions about the assignment, with Patrick advising against random approaches and instead recommending pre-arranged observations, though he offered to connect students with willing participants if needed.

### Shadowing Assignment and Updates

The class discussed the upcoming shadowing assignment, which will take place during the next class period from 2:30 to 3:00 PM on Wednesday. Patrick clarified that students should email him confirmation of their shadowing arrangements, and he will mark their participation in Canvas. Several students, including Felix and Dyan, shared their progress in finding shadowing candidates, with Dyan successfully contacting Dean Andrews. Patrick advised students to reach out to staff and faculty in their respective buildings if they are struggling to find participants. The class also addressed the "find the duct tape" assignment, with Tushar requesting an extension due to weather-related difficulties. Patrick agreed to review Tushar's work and provide feedback via email.
