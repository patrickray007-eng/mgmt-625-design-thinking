<h1>Tell the Story of Your Project</h1>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>This is the culmination of your design thinking work. Your team will tell the complete story of your project, from the world as you found it, through what you learned, to what you built and what happened when real people used it.</p>

<p>The format is yours to choose. Film, live demo, physical installation, audio piece, performance, printed artifact, or something else entirely. What matters is that you tell a compelling, evidence-grounded story and that your audience is part of the experience, not just watching it.</p>

<p>This is not a slide presentation about your findings. It's a story about a problem, the people who experience it, and what happened when you tried to do something about it.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tell a complete problem-to-solution narrative grounded in research evidence</li>
  <li>Demonstrate full traceability from empathy work to prototype</li>
  <li>Build and test a prototype with real stakeholders (experiment rapidly)</li>
  <li>Show iteration and refinement based on feedback and stress testing</li>
  <li>Choose a communication format intentionally, matching medium to message</li>
  <li>Engage an audience as participants, not just spectators</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Story Arc</h2>

<p>Your story should follow a three-act structure. This is a guide, not a rigid template. How you move through these acts depends on your format.</p>

<h3>Act 1: The World As It Is</h3>

<p>Introduce us to the people and the problem. Who are your stakeholders? What does their world look like? What's broken, missing, or held together with duct tape?</p>

<p>This is where your empathy work lives. Specific observations, real quotes, the things you saw and heard that shaped your understanding. By the end of Act 1, your audience should <em>feel</em> the problem, not just understand it intellectually.</p>

<h3>Act 2: What You Learned and How It Changed Your Thinking</h3>

<p>Take us into the messy middle. What did your research reveal that surprised you? How did your causal loop analysis deepen your understanding of why this problem persists? What happened when your assumptions got stress-tested?</p>

<p>This is where iteration evidence lives. Show us how your thinking evolved from the Mid-Project Gallery Walk to now. What changed and why? What did you let go of? What emerged?</p>

<h3>Act 3: What You Built and What Happened</h3>

<p>Show us the prototype. Not a concept deck, not a wireframe you never tested. Something real that you put in front of actual people. It doesn't need to be polished. It needs to exist and it needs to have been used.</p>

<p>What happened when stakeholders encountered it? What worked? What didn't? What would you test next? End with the human impact: how did the experience change for the people you set out to help?</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Time Block</h3>

<p>Each team gets a <strong>9-minute block</strong>. How you use those 9 minutes is up to you. A 4-minute film followed by 5 minutes of live audience discussion. A 2-minute setup, 5-minute interactive demo, and 2-minute debrief. Whatever serves your story.</p>

<p>If your format requires setup time beyond a laptop and projector, plan for that within your 9 minutes or arrange to set up during the preceding team's block.</p>

<h3>Prototype</h3>

<p>You must build and test a prototype with at least one real stakeholder. "Experiment rapidly" is a core design ability. Remember the constraint: if your solution had to be buildable in 24 hours, what would you make? Start there.</p>

<p>The prototype can be rough. Paper, cardboard, a simple digital mockup, a role-played service interaction. What matters is that it was real enough to learn from and that you actually put it in someone's hands.</p>

<h3>Audience Involvement</h3>

<p>Your 9 minutes must involve the audience in some way. They should not be passive for the entire block. This could be a discussion prompt, an interactive moment, a physical artifact passed around, a question posed mid-story, a live demonstration they participate in. The form is up to you, but the audience must be engaged, not just watching.</p>

<h3>Format Rationale</h3>

<p>Submit a brief written rationale (one paragraph) <strong>48 hours before Session 12</strong> explaining:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What format your team chose</li>
  <li>Why this format best tells your particular story</li>
  <li>Any special setup needs (equipment, space, time to arrange materials)</li>
</ul>

<p>Default setup is a projector and screen. Anything beyond that needs advance notice so we can prepare.</p>

<h2>Format Examples</h2>

<p>These are possibilities, not a checklist. Mix, combine, or invent your own.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Short film</strong> + live discussion</li>
  <li><strong>Live prototype demo</strong> with audience participation</li>
  <li><strong>Physical installation</strong> the audience walks through or interacts with</li>
  <li><strong>Audio documentary</strong> + guided visual or reflective exercise</li>
  <li><strong>Performance or skit</strong> dramatizing the stakeholder experience</li>
  <li><strong>Printed artifact</strong> (zine, poster series, field guide) + walkthrough</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed media</strong> combining multiple formats</li>
</ul>

<p>The best format is the one that serves your story. Choose intentionally.</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p><strong>48 hours before Session 12:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Format rationale submitted on Canvas (one paragraph, plus any special setup needs)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Session 12 (Monday, March 2):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>In-class story presentation (9-minute block)</li>
  <li>Audience involvement integrated into your block</li>

</ul>

<h2>Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)</h2>

<p>This assignment is graded on a <strong>Meets Specifications / Revise</strong> basis. All team members receive the same grade.</p>

<h3>Specification 1: Problem Clarity</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Problem is clearly communicated. Audience understands who experiences it, what it is, and why it matters. The human dimension is vivid, with specific stakeholders and contexts, not abstract or generic.</td>
      <td>Problem is vague or too broad. No clear stakeholders. Audience can't identify who is affected or why. Problem feels abstract rather than grounded in real people.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 2: Research Evidence</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Story includes 3+ concrete examples from research: specific quotes, observations, or moments from empathy work. Evidence is specific enough that it couldn't have been fabricated. Clear that the team engaged deeply with stakeholders.</td>
      <td>Research is vague or generic. No specific quotes or observations. Story could have been told without conducting any research.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 3: Traceability</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Clear narrative thread from research to insights to problem to solution. Audience can follow how specific discoveries led to the prototype direction. The "why this solution for this problem" question is answered through the story, not just stated.</td>
      <td>Solution appears disconnected from research. No clear logic chain. Audience can't see how empathy work shaped what was built.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 4: Prototype and Testing</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Team built a prototype and tested it with at least one real stakeholder. The prototype is visible in the story (shown, demonstrated, or documented). Team shares what they learned from testing, including what didn't work.</td>
      <td>No prototype exists, or prototype was never tested with a real person. Testing evidence is missing or fabricated. Team only presents concepts without having built anything.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 5: Iteration Evidence</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Story shows how thinking evolved from mid-project to final. Specific changes based on gallery walk feedback and stress testing are visible. Demonstrates genuine learning and refinement, not just polishing the same idea.</td>
      <td>No evidence of iteration. Final work is unchanged from mid-project. Feedback and stress testing appear to have been ignored.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 6: Format Intentionality and Audience Engagement</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Format choice is intentional and justified in the written rationale. The chosen medium genuinely serves the story (not just a standard presentation with a gimmick). Audience is involved in a meaningful way during the 9-minute block.</td>
      <td>Format feels arbitrary or unjustified. Medium doesn't serve the story. Audience is passive throughout. Or format rationale is missing.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> Assignment meets specifications when ALL SIX specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the team should revise and resubmit supporting materials with a written reflection on what they would change.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Great Story</h2>

<p>The best versions of this assignment make the audience feel something. They introduce you to real people, take you into a real problem, show you the team grappling with complexity, and then put something tangible in front of the people who need it. The format is in service of that feeling, not a substitute for substance.</p>

<p>Show your thinking. Show your process. Show what happened when your ideas met reality.</p>
