<h1>Distributed Research Guidelines</h1>

<h2>Why Distributed Research?</h2>

<p>In a hybrid course, team members access different workplaces, industries, cities, and communities. This geographic and professional diversity is a research asset.</p>

<h2>Planning Your Team's Research</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Map your combined reach:</strong> What contexts can each member access?</li>
  <li><strong>Identify stakeholders:</strong> Which stakeholders can each member observe or interview?</li>
  <li><strong>Divide responsibilities:</strong> Maximize coverage while avoiding duplication</li>
  <li><strong>Set coordination rhythm:</strong> How will you check in between Sessions 3 and 4?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Coordination Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Create a shared document early (Google Doc, Notion, etc.)</li>
  <li>Set up a team channel (Slack, GroupMe, text thread)</li>
  <li>Schedule at least one video check-in during the research period</li>
  <li>Share findings as you go—don't wait until the deadline</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each member: 1-2 substantial observations or interviews</li>
  <li>Focus on depth, not breadth</li>
  <li>Document in your notebook; compile for team</li>
  <li>Note what's unique to your context vs. what might be universal</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before Session 4</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Compile all findings into team document</li>
  <li>Look for patterns across contexts</li>
  <li>Note where different contexts revealed different facets of the problem</li>
  <li>Identify remaining questions and assumptions</li>
</ul>
