# Problem Definition Report

## Assignment Overview

This document synthesizes your team's empathy work (stakeholder mapping, [[A03-Causal-Loop-Map|causal loop analysis]], and observations) into a clear, bounded problem definition.

This report serves as the foundation for your [[A05-Mid-Project-Presentation|Mid-Project Gallery Walk]] (Session 10) and [[A06-Final-Presentation|Tell the Story of Your Project]] (Session 12).

## Learning Objectives

- Synthesize diverse research findings into a coherent problem statement
- Articulate a bounded, specific, and actionable problem
- Connect problem definition to evidence from empathy work
- Demonstrate traceability from observation to problem framing

## Instructions

### Document Structure

Your Problem Definition Report should include:

#### 1. Problem Statement

Write a clear, bounded problem statement that:
- Identifies **who** experiences the problem (specific stakeholder group)
- Describes **what** the problem is (observable, not assumed)
- Explains **how** the problem affects stakeholders, including how it makes them feel
- Explains **why** it matters (impact on stakeholders)
- Indicates **scope** (what's included and excluded)

Good example: *"Mid-level managers at healthcare organizations struggle to surface patient feedback to senior leadership because existing reporting systems prioritize quantitative metrics over qualitative insights. These managers feel frustrated and powerless, knowing that patient experience issues keep recurring but unable to make leadership aware. The result is a growing sense of disconnection between frontline care and organizational decision-making."*

Weak example: *"Communication in organizations is broken."*

#### 2. Evidence Summary

Summarize the research that led to this problem definition:
- Key findings from stakeholder mapping (Session 6)
- Insights from [[A03-Causal-Loop-Map|causal loop analysis]]
- Observations and interviews from your team's Project 2 research

This section should make clear that your problem definition is **grounded in evidence**, not assumption.

#### 3. Stakeholder Tensions

Identify the key tensions between stakeholders:
- Where do stakeholder interests conflict?
- What trade-offs exist in the current system?
- Who would need to change behavior for the problem to be solved?

#### 4. Initial Solution Directions

Briefly identify 2-3 directions your team might explore for solutions:
- These are not fully developed solutions, just directions worth investigating
- For each, note which stakeholder insight points toward this direction
- You'll develop these further for Session 10 and Session 12

## Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)

This assignment is graded on a **Meets Specifications / Revise** basis. All team members receive the same grade.

### Specification 1: Problem Statement Quality

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Problem statement identifies specific stakeholders, observable problem, and clear scope. Problem is bounded (not trying to solve everything). Statement could guide solution development, making it clear what would and wouldn't address this problem. | Problem statement is vague, unbounded, or too broad. Stakeholders are generic ("people" or "users"). Problem is assumed rather than observed. Scope is unclear and could mean anything. |

### Specification 2: Evidence Grounding

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Evidence summary includes specific findings from team's research: quotes, observations, examples from stakeholder mapping and team research. Clear connection between research and problem definition. Reader can see how empathy work led to this understanding. | Evidence is thin, generic, or missing. Problem definition could have been written on day one without research. No specific quotes or observations. Research section reads like filler rather than foundation. |

### Specification 3: Stakeholder Tension Analysis

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Identifies genuine tensions between stakeholder groups. Explains why the problem persists (competing interests, structural constraints). Shows understanding that solutions may create trade-offs or resistance. | No tensions identified, or tensions are superficial. Assumes all stakeholders want the same thing. Does not address why the problem hasn't already been solved. |

### Specification 4: Document Completeness

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| All four sections present and complete. Writing is clear and professional. Formatting aids readability. Each section has sufficient depth to demonstrate genuine engagement. | Missing sections or significantly incomplete. Writing is unclear or disorganized. Sections are thin or padded with irrelevant content. |

---

**Overall:** Assignment meets specifications when ALL FOUR specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the assignment should be revised and resubmitted.
