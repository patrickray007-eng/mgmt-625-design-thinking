# Mid-Project Gallery Walk

## Assignment Overview

The Mid-Project Gallery Walk is a checkpoint to share your problem definition and early solution concepts with the class. This is not a final pitch. It's an opportunity to articulate your thinking, receive written feedback from peers, and identify what needs more work before the final session.

The goal is **traceability**: showing how your research led to your problem definition, and how your problem definition is guiding your solution directions.

## Learning Objectives

- Communicate problem definition clearly and concisely through visual materials
- Demonstrate connection between empathy work and problem framing
- Present early solution concepts grounded in research
- Receive and integrate written peer feedback
- Identify gaps and areas for further development
- Practice giving constructive, specific feedback to other teams

## Instructions

### Station Setup

Each team prepares a station (table or wall space) that visitors can engage with independently. Your station should tell the story of your project so far.

#### What to include at your station:

**1. Problem Definition (prominent, easy to read)**
- What problem is your team addressing?
- Who experiences it and why does it matter?
- What did you observe or learn that led to this framing?
- What makes this problem hard to solve? (reference your [[A03-Causal-Loop-Map|causal loop]])

**2. Research Highlights**
- Key stakeholder quotes or observations
- Your causal loop map (printed or drawn)
- Any artifacts from your empathy work (photos, journey maps, etc.)

**3. Early Concepts (1-2 solution directions)**
- How does each connect to specific research insights?
- What questions or uncertainties remain?
- What feedback would be most helpful? (post this as a specific question for visitors)

### Gallery Walk Format

- Each team leaves **one member** at their station to answer questions (rotate halfway through)
- Remaining team members visit other stations in small groups
- At each station you visit, **leave written feedback** on the provided cards or sticky notes
- Spend roughly **5 minutes per station**

### Feedback Guidelines

When visiting other stations, write feedback that addresses:
- Where was the problem-to-concept connection clearest?
- What question do you have about their research or reasoning?
- What suggestion would you offer for strengthening their direction?

### Station Preparation Tips

**Do:**
- Show your thinking, not polish
- Reference specific observations, quotes, or stakeholder insights
- Acknowledge what you don't know yet
- Post a specific question you want visitors to answer
- Make materials readable from a few feet away

**Don't:**
- Create a polished sales pitch
- Present solutions as final
- Hide uncertainties
- Rely only on a laptop screen (have at least some printed or drawn materials)

### Visual Aids

- Printed or hand-drawn materials work well
- Your [[A03-Causal-Loop-Map|causal loop map]] and stakeholder maps are useful visuals
- Slides on a laptop can supplement but should not be the only thing at your station
- Consider large-format prints of key diagrams

## Deliverables

In Session 10 (Monday, February 23):
- [ ] Team station set up and ready by 2:20 PM
- [ ] Station materials covering problem definition, research highlights, and early concepts
- [ ] One team member stationed at all times to field questions
- [ ] Written feedback left at every station you visit
- [ ] Station materials (photos or files) uploaded to Canvas after session

## Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)

This assignment is graded on a **Meets Specifications / Revise** basis. All team members receive the same grade.

### Specification 1: Problem Clarity

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Problem is clearly articulated at the station. Visitors can understand who experiences the problem, what it is, and why it matters without needing extensive explanation. Problem scope is bounded and specific. | Problem is vague, confusing, or poorly scoped. Visitors can't identify specific stakeholders affected. Problem is too broad or unclear. Station requires extensive verbal explanation to make sense. |

### Specification 2: Research Connection

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Station includes specific observations, stakeholder insights, or research findings. Clear that the team conducted empathy work and learned from it. Problem definition is grounded in evidence. | Research section is vague or missing. No specific observations or quotes. Problem could have been defined without doing any research. |

### Specification 3: Solution Grounding

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Solution directions are connected to specific insights from research. Station materials explain why research points toward these directions. Solutions are presented as explorations, not final answers. | Solutions appear disconnected from research. No explanation of why research led to these directions. Solutions presented as finished without acknowledging uncertainty. |

### Specification 4: Station Quality

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Station is well-organized and can be understood by visitors with minimal verbal guidance. Materials are readable and visually clear. Team member at station engages constructively with visitors. | Station is disorganized or impossible to follow without extensive explanation. Materials are illegible or missing key elements. Station is unattended. |

### Specification 5: Peer Feedback Participation

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Team visits all other stations and leaves substantive written feedback at each. Feedback is specific and constructive, referencing what they observed at the station. | Team does not visit all stations. Feedback is missing, generic, or unhelpful. No evidence of genuine engagement with other teams' work. |

---

**Overall:** Assignment meets specifications when ALL FIVE specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the team should incorporate feedback for Session 12 (Tell the Story of Your Project).

## What Happens Next

Based on feedback from the gallery walk and the Session 11 Assumption Audit + Stress Test, you'll refine your problem definition and solution concepts for [[A06-Final-Presentation|Tell the Story of Your Project]] (Session 12).
