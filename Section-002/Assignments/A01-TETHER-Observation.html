<h1>TETHER Observation</h1>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>TETHER stands for <strong>T</strong>ake <strong>E</strong>xtended <strong>T</strong>ime to <strong>H</strong>old <strong>E</strong>verything in <strong>R</strong>eview. This assignment develops your capacity to observe without immediately interpreting or solving, a foundational design thinking skill.</p>

<p>You will spend 90 uninterrupted minutes observing in an environment of your choosing. Unlike traditional campus-based fieldwork, you'll observe in your own context: your workplace, a local coffee shop, public transit, a grocery store, or another location where you can watch people interact with systems, spaces, and each other.</p>

<p>This distributed approach is intentional. Your unique vantage point contributes to our collective understanding when we share observations in Session 2.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Practice sustained observation without interpretation</li>
  <li>Develop awareness of your own assumptions and attention patterns</li>
  <li>Document observable behaviors, movements, and interactions</li>
  <li>Reflect on the experience of observing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Before Your Observation</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Choose your location.</strong> Select a place in your own environment where:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>You can observe for 90 uninterrupted minutes</li>
  <li>People interact with systems, spaces, or each other</li>
  <li>You can sit or stand comfortably without drawing attention</li>
  <li>Good options: workplace common area, coffee shop, grocery store, transit station, park, library</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare your materials.</strong> Bring only:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Your notebook</li>
  <li>A pen</li>
  <li>Phone on silent and put away (not for reference)</li>
</ul>

<h3>During Your Observation (90 minutes)</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Document what you see, not what you think it means.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Movements: Where do people go? How do they move through space?</li>
  <li>Pauses: Where do people stop? What makes them hesitate?</li>
  <li>Interactions: How do people engage with each other? With objects? With the environment?</li>
  <li>Objects: What do people carry, use, touch, ignore?</li>
  <li>Spaces: How is the space organized? Where do people cluster or avoid?</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Resist the urge to interpret or solve.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Write "Person looked at phone, then looked around, then walked to counter"</li>
  <li>NOT "Person was confused about where to go"</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Note your assumptions separately.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>When you catch yourself making an assumption, write it in the margin</li>
  <li>Example: "I assumed she was waiting for someone, but I don't actually know that"</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Stay for the full 90 minutes.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>The discipline of extended observation reveals patterns that shorter observations miss</li>
</ul>

<h3>After Your Observation</h3>

<p>Write a <strong>half-page reflection</strong> (approximately 250 words) addressing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What was difficult about observing without interpreting?</li>
  <li>What did you notice about your own attention? Where did it drift?</li>
  <li>What surprised you about what you observed?</li>
  <li>What might you do differently next time?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>Bring to Session 2 (Saturday, March 7):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notebook with 90 minutes of raw observations (minimum 3-4 pages)</li>
  <li>Assumptions noted separately in margins</li>
  <li>Half-page written reflection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>This assignment is graded as part of your <strong>Notebook</strong> grade. Your TETHER observation will be submitted with your notebook at Session 6. Credit is awarded based on the number of specifications met.</p>

<h3>Specifications</h3>

<p><strong>1. Observation Duration and Depth</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Observations clearly reflect 90 minutes of sustained attention. Notes span at least 3-4 pages and include multiple types of observations (movements, interactions, objects, spaces). Timestamps or time markers indicate sustained engagement throughout the observation period.</td>
      <td>Observations appear rushed or superficial. Notes are sparse (fewer than 2 pages) or repetitive. No evidence of sustained attention over the full 90 minutes. Observations cluster around a single moment rather than spanning the full period.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>2. Descriptive vs. Interpretive</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Observations focus on observable behaviors and facts. Language describes what happened without inferring motivation, emotion, or meaning. When interpretations appear, they are flagged as assumptions. Example: "Woman checked watch three times in two minutes" rather than "Woman was impatient."</td>
      <td>Observations are primarily interpretive or judgmental. Notes assume motivations, emotions, or intentions without observable evidence. Assumptions are presented as facts. Example: "Rude customer ignored the barista" rather than describing the observable behavior.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>3. Assumption Awareness</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Margins or separate section includes at least 3-5 assumptions the observer caught themselves making. Assumptions are specific and connected to observations. Demonstrates metacognitive awareness of the observer's own biases and inferences.</td>
      <td>No assumptions identified, or assumptions are vague/generic. No evidence of reflection on the observer's own interpretive tendencies. Observer appears unaware of the difference between observation and inference.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>4. Reflection Quality</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Reflection is approximately 250 words and addresses all prompts: difficulty of observing without interpreting, attention patterns, surprises, and future adjustments. Shows genuine engagement with the experience and specific examples from the observation.</td>
      <td>Reflection is missing, significantly under length, or superficial. Does not address the prompts or provides only generic responses without specific examples. Does not demonstrate learning from the experience.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
