<h1>Problem Reflection 1</h1>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>This reflection closes Project 1 (individual observation work) and prepares you for Project 2 (team-based scenario work). You'll examine what you learned about observation, problem identification, and your own tendencies as a designer.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Synthesize learning from TETHER observation, video observation (Session 2), and shadowing (Session 3)</li>
  <li>Articulate the difference between observing and interpreting</li>
  <li>Identify personal patterns and growth areas in design thinking practice</li>
  <li>Connect individual observation experience to upcoming team work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Write a <strong>400-600 word reflection</strong> addressing the following:</p>

<h3>Part 1: The Observation Experience</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What did you learn about observation from your TETHER experience and shadowing?</li>
  <li>What was harder than you expected? What was easier?</li>
  <li>How did the different observation modes (video, in-person TETHER, shadowing) reveal different things?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 2: Problems and Assumptions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What problem or friction did you observe in your environment or during shadowing?</li>
  <li>What assumptions did you make about why the problem exists?</li>
  <li>Looking back, which of those assumptions were actually supported by what you observed vs. what you inferred?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 3: Looking Forward</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What will you carry forward from Project 1 into your team's Project 2 work?</li>
  <li>What do you want to do differently when observing stakeholders for your team's scenario?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>Submit to Canvas before Session 5 (Wednesday, February 4):</p>

<ul>
  <li>400-600 word reflection addressing all three parts</li>
  <li>Submitted as PDF or Word document</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)</h2>

<p>This assignment is graded on a <strong>Meets Specifications / Revise</strong> basis.</p>

<h3>Specification 1: Substantive Engagement with Observation Experience</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Reflection includes specific examples from the [[A01-TETHER-Observation</td>
      <td>TETHER observation]] and shadowing. Demonstrates genuine reflection on what was learned, not just description of what happened. Addresses challenges and insights with specificity.</td>
      <td>Reflection is vague or generic. Lacks specific examples from the actual observation experience. Describes activities without reflecting on learning. Could have been written without completing the observation.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 2: Distinction Between Observation and Interpretation</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Clearly articulates the difference between observable facts and inferences/assumptions. Provides specific examples of assumptions made during observation. Shows awareness of which conclusions were supported by evidence vs. inferred.</td>
      <td>Conflates observation with interpretation. Does not demonstrate understanding of the distinction. Cannot identify specific assumptions or does not examine whether assumptions were supported by evidence.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 3: Forward Application</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Identifies specific, actionable insights to carry into Project 2. Connects individual observation learning to upcoming team-based stakeholder research. Shows intentionality about how to improve or apply learning.</td>
      <td>Does not connect Project 1 learning to Project 2. Forward-looking section is vague or missing. No actionable insights identified.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 4: Length and Completeness</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Reflection is 400-600 words. All three parts (observation experience, problems/assumptions, looking forward) are addressed. Writing is clear and organized.</td>
      <td>Significantly under or over word count. One or more parts are missing or inadequately addressed. Writing is unclear or disorganized.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> Assignment meets specifications when ALL FOUR specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the assignment should be revised and resubmitted.</p>
