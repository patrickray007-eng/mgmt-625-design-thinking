# Session 3: Stakeholder Mapping + Research Planning

**Thursday, March 12, 2026 | 6:30-8:00 PM | Online (Zoom)**

---

## Topics

- Identifying and mapping stakeholders for your team's scenario
- Extreme users and overlooked perspectives
- The transition from observation to empathy interviews
- Planning distributed research that leverages your team's combined reach

## What We'll Do

- Quick team check-ins: Has your thinking shifted since Session 2?
- **Stakeholder Mapping** (breakout rooms): Identify 4-5 stakeholders for your scenario, including at least one extreme user. For each, map what they optimize for, what constrains them, and which team member can access them.
- Full-group debrief: Share one stakeholder your team almost forgot
- **Research Planning** (breakout rooms): Design your team's two-week research plan. Who can each member reach? What will each person do (observation, interview, or both)? How will you coordinate and compile findings?
- Close: Share research plans and confirm deliverables

## What to Bring

- Problem Reflection submitted to Canvas before class
- Notebook

## Assignments

| Assignment | Status | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| [[A02-Problem-Reflection\|Problem Reflection]] | **Due this session** | Submit 400-600 word reflection to Canvas before class |
| [[A03-Stakeholder-Research\|Stakeholder Research]] | **Released this session** | Team: Each member conducts 1-2 observations or interviews. Compile into team document. Due Session 4. |
| [[A04-Causal-Loop-Map\|Causal Loop Map]] | **Released this session** | Team: Diagram showing problem dynamics, feedback loops, and who benefits. Due Session 4. |

## The Research Period (March 12-26)

After this session, your team has **two weeks of distributed fieldwork**:
- Each team member conducts 1-2 substantial observations or interviews in their own context
- Focus on depth, not breadth
- Document in your notebook; contribute to your team's shared document
- Coordinate with your team asynchronously
- Compile findings before Session 4

## Ongoing Notebook Practice

**Find the Duct Tape**: Document one workaround or improvised fix you encountered this week.

## Looking Ahead

- **Stakeholder Research** and **Causal Loop Map** are both due Session 4 (Thursday, March 26)
- **Session 4** is Thursday, March 26, 6:30-8:00 PM, **online** via Zoom
- Use the two-week gap to conduct research in your own environments
