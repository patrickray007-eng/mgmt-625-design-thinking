<h1>Reflection Essay</h1>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>This reflection closes the course by examining your design thinking learning and how you'll apply it in your professional context. You'll consider which design abilities resonated, where you tend to jump to solutions, and how distributed research across diverse environments enriched your team's work.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reflect on personal growth across the 7 design abilities</li>
  <li>Connect design thinking practices to professional contexts</li>
  <li>Evaluate how distributed research and diverse team contexts strengthened problem understanding</li>
  <li>Articulate transferable skills from the course</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Write a <strong>500-800 word reflection</strong> addressing the following:</p>

<h3>Part 1: Design Abilities</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Which of the 7 design abilities felt most natural to you? Most challenging?</li>
  <li>What specific moment or activity during the course shifted your thinking about one of these abilities?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 2: Professional Application</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Where in your professional context do you jump to solutions too quickly?</li>
  <li>How might you apply "Navigate Ambiguity" or "Learn From Others" in your work?</li>
  <li>How might you use observation or stakeholder mapping in your professional role?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 3: The Value of Diverse Contexts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What did you learn from your teammates' diverse contexts during the distributed research period?</li>
  <li>How did having team members in different industries, cities, or environments enrich your understanding of the problem?</li>
  <li>What would have been different if everyone had researched in the same location?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>Submit to Canvas before Session 6 (Thursday, April 9):</p>

<ul>
  <li>500-800 word reflection addressing all three parts</li>
  <li>Submitted as PDF or Word document</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)</h2>

    <tr>
      <td>Identifies specific design abilities that felt natural and challenging with concrete examples from the course. Demonstrates genuine self-awareness about personal strengths and growth areas. References specific moments or activities.</td>
      <td>Vague or generic statements about design abilities. Cannot identify specific examples from course activities. Lists abilities without reflecting on personal experience with them.</td>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Provides concrete examples of where design thinking practices could be applied in their professional context. Identifies specific situations where they tend to jump to solutions. Shows intentionality about applying observation or stakeholder mapping at work.</td>
      <td>Professional application is vague or hypothetical. Cannot identify specific situations in their work context. Generic statements that could apply to anyone.</td>
    </tr>
