<h1>Final Presentation</h1>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>Your Final Presentation is the culmination of your team's design thinking work. You'll present your complete problem-to-solution arc, demonstrating how your empathy work shaped your understanding and led to your solution concepts.</p>

<p>This is not a polished pitch. It's a demonstration of design thinking in action. The goal is <strong>traceability</strong>: showing how your research led to insights, how insights shaped your problem definition, and how your problem definition guided your solution concepts.</p>

<p>Your uploaded slides or visual aids serve as the submitted artifact for this assignment.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Communicate a complex problem-to-solution narrative clearly and concisely</li>
  <li>Demonstrate full traceability from empathy work to solution concepts</li>
  <li>Show iteration and refinement based on feedback and stress testing</li>
  <li>Present evidence-based reasoning to an audience</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Presentation Structure (7-8 minutes)</h3>

<h4>1. The Problem (2-3 minutes)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What problem did you investigate?</li>
  <li>Who experiences it and why does it matter?</li>
  <li>What makes this problem hard to solve?</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Your Research Journey (2-3 minutes)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What did you learn that you didn't expect?</li>
  <li>What specific insights shaped your understanding?</li>
  <li>Include 2-3 concrete examples: quotes, observations, or moments that mattered</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Your Solution (2-3 minutes)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What solution concept are you proposing?</li>
  <li>How does it connect to specific research insights?</li>
  <li>What assumptions does it depend on?</li>
  <li>What would you test first?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Q&A (2 minutes)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about your research, reasoning, and assumptions</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Your Presentation Should Cover</h3>

<p>Your presentation should demonstrate the full arc of your design thinking work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem definition</strong>: Your final, refined problem statement (who, what, how it affects them, why it matters, scope)</li>
  <li><strong>Research evidence</strong>: Key findings from fieldwork, shadowing, and stakeholder mapping, with specific quotes or observations</li>
  <li><strong>Systems analysis</strong>: How your causal loop map informed your understanding of why the problem persists</li>
  <li><strong>Solution hypotheses</strong>: 1-2 concepts framed as testable hypotheses, with key assumptions identified</li>
  <li><strong>Iteration</strong>: How your thinking evolved from the Mid-Project Presentation based on feedback and stress testing</li>
  <li><strong>Traceability</strong>: The visible logic chain from research to insights to problem to solution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Presentation Guidelines</h3>

<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Show your thinking, not just conclusions</li>
  <li>Use specific evidence from your research</li>
  <li>Acknowledge what you don't know</li>
  <li>Show how you iterated based on feedback</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Don't:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a polished sales pitch</li>
  <li>Hide uncertainties</li>
  <li>Present solutions without grounding in research</li>
  <li>Ignore what you learned from stress testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>Session 12 (Monday, March 2):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team presentation (7-8 minutes)</li>
  <li>Q&A participation (2 minutes)</li>
  <li>Slides or visual aids uploaded to Canvas after session</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)</h2>

<p>This assignment is graded on a <strong>Meets Specifications / Revise</strong> basis. All team members receive the same grade.</p>

<h3>Specification 1: Problem Clarity</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Problem is clearly articulated with specific stakeholders, observable symptoms, and bounded scope. Explanation of why the problem persists demonstrates depth of understanding.</td>
      <td>Problem is vague or too broad. No clear stakeholders. Does not explain why the problem is hard to solve.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 2: Research Evidence</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Presentation includes 3+ concrete examples from research: specific quotes, observations, or insights. Evidence is specific enough that it couldn't have been fabricated. Clear that the team conducted genuine empathy work.</td>
      <td>Research section is vague or generic. No specific quotes or observations. Could have been written without conducting research.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 3: Traceability</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Clear logical chain from research to insights to problem to solution. Audience can follow how specific insights led to solution directions. Solutions are grounded in evidence, not just ideas the team liked.</td>
      <td>Solutions appear disconnected from research. No clear logic chain. Audience can't see how empathy work shaped the solution.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 4: Assumption Awareness</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Solution hypotheses identify key assumptions. Team acknowledges what they don't know. Evidence of learning from stress testing. Can articulate what they would test next.</td>
      <td>Presents solutions as certainties. Does not acknowledge assumptions. No evidence of iteration based on feedback.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 5: Iteration Evidence</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Presentation shows how thinking evolved from mid-project to final. Specific changes based on feedback and stress testing are visible. Demonstrates learning and refinement.</td>
      <td>No evidence of iteration. Final work is identical to mid-project. Feedback and stress testing appear to have been ignored.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 6: Presentation Delivery</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Presentation is 7-8 minutes. All team members contribute. Organized and easy to follow. Team handles Q&A thoughtfully.</td>
      <td>Significantly over/under time. One person dominates. Disorganized. Dismissive or unprepared for Q&A.</td>
    </tr>
