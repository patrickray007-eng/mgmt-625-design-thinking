>
> ## The 7 Design Abilities
>
> This course develops the Stanford d.school's Design Abilities—underlying capabilities learners can apply in any problem space.
>
> 1. **Navigate Ambiguity** — Persist in the discomfort of not knowing; develop tactics to overcome ambiguity.
> 2. **Learn From Others** — Empathize with diverse viewpoints; observe and learn from unfamiliar contexts.
> 3. **Synthesize Information** — Make sense of information and find insight within.
> 4. **Experiment Rapidly** — Quickly generate ideas—written, drawn, or built.
> 5. **Move Between Concrete and Abstract** — Zoom in and out between details and big picture.
> 6. **Build and Craft Intentionally** — Show work at appropriate resolution for feedback desired.
> 7. **Communicate Deliberately** — Form and relate stories, ideas, and learnings to audiences.
>
> ## Course Structure
>
> ### Two Projects
> - **Project 1** (Sessions 1-4): Individual, campus-based observation and problem framing.
> - **Project 2** (Sessions 5-12): Teams of 5, business/nonprofit scenario through full design cycle.
>
> ### Three Phases
> - **Phase 1** — Empathy and Observation (Sessions 1-4): Building observational discipline.
> - **Phase 2** — Problem Definition (Sessions 5-8): Framing, reframing, articulating problems.
> - **Phase 3** — Ideation and Testing (Sessions 9-12): Generating and stress-testing solutions.

> [!note]- Pedagogical Approach
>
> ## Inquiry-Based Learning
>
> This course uses an **Explore → Make Sense → Name** pattern:
> - **Explore:** Learners dive into activities without full scaffolding.
> - **Make Sense:** Surface discoveries, struggles, and patterns collectively.
> - **Name:** Introduce vocabulary and frameworks after experience.
>
> ## The Notebook
>
> Each learner maintains a notebook (physical or digital) as their design thinking artifact. Contains: Find the Duct Tape entries, TETHER observation, shadowing notes, in-class activities, stakeholder maps, causal loops, and reflections. Submitted Session 12; graded on completion.
>
> ## One Action Item Between Classes
>
> To manage cognitive load, learners receive only one substantive action item between sessions. The notebook serves as ongoing practice space.

> [!tip]- Grading Framework
>
> Specifications-based grading. Credit awarded based on the number of specifications met. Manageable without a TA.
>
> | Component | Weight | Notes |
> |-----------|--------|-------|
> | Attendance & Participation | 25% | Present, on time, engaged in activities and discussions |
> | Individual Assignments | 35% | Notebook (includes Find the Duct Tape entries), TETHER (part of Notebook), Problem Reflection 1 |
> | Team Assignments | 40% | Causal Loop Map, Problem Definition Report, Mid-Project Gallery Walk, Tell the Story of Your Project |
>
> *Source: Syllabus distributed to students. The exact mix of assignments may be adjusted based on class needs.*
>
> ## Token System
>
> 6 tokens per learner: 3 for 24-hour extensions, 3 for revisions.
>
> ## Group Formation
>
> Project 1: Individual. Project 2: Teams formed Session 5 by scenario selection. 7 teams.

> [!abstract]- Project 2: Bird's Eye View
>
> ### The Arc
>
> Project 2 is a team design challenge that runs Sessions 5-12. Here is the full journey:
>
> - **Sessions 5-6: Understand the Problem Space** -- Select your scenario, form your team, identify stakeholders, and begin research. You are learning to see the problem from multiple perspectives.
> - **Sessions 7-8: Define the Problem** -- Reframe through multiple lenses, build a causal loop map, and arrive at a bounded problem definition. You are making sense of what you found.
> - **Sessions 9-11: Ideate and Test** -- Generate solution concepts, frame them as testable hypotheses, and stress test your assumptions. You are building and testing ideas grounded in evidence.
> - **Session 12: Communicate** -- Present the full arc with traceability from problem to solution. You are telling the story of your thinking.
>
> ### Design Abilities by Phase
>
> Navigate Ambiguity runs throughout the entire project. The other abilities come into focus at different stages:
>
> | Phase | Sessions | Primary Abilities |
> |-------|----------|-------------------|
> | Understand | 5-6 | Learn From Others, Synthesize Information |
> | Define | 7-8 | Synthesize Information, Move Between Concrete and Abstract |
> | Ideate + Test | 9-11 | Experiment Rapidly, Build and Craft Intentionally |
> | Communicate | 12 | Communicate Deliberately, Build and Craft Intentionally |
>
> ### Choosing Your Subject
>
> A **scenario** is a broad problem space. A **subject** is your team's specific investigation within it.
>
> **Examples:**
> - Scenario A (First 90 Days) + Subject: "How do new nurses navigate their first rotation at a community hospital?"
> - Scenario D (Access Barriers) + Subject: "Why do eligible families in one school district not use the free tutoring program?"
> - Scenario B (Small Business Friction) + Subject: "What operational workarounds do independent coffee shop owners rely on daily?"
>
> **How to choose well:**
> - Pick a subject where your team can access real stakeholders (you need to observe and talk to people, not just read about them)
> - Keep it bounded: one organization, one location, or one population
> - Follow genuine curiosity, not what seems "important"
> - Aim for no more than 3 stakeholder groups

> [!example]- Project 2 Scenarios
>
> Teams select one scenario. Each provides a problem space with room to choose a specific subject.
>
> ### Business Scenarios
>
> **A: The First 90 Days**
> *How do new employees learn to navigate an organization?*
> Choose an organization type and explore the new employee experience. What isn't taught? Who helps? What falls through the cracks?
>
> **B: Small Business Friction**
> *What makes running a small business harder than it needs to be?*
> Choose a small business type and explore operational friction. What systems don't work together? What workarounds exist?
>
> **C: The Feedback Gap**
> *How do organizations learn what's not working?*
> Explore how feedback flows—or doesn't—between customers, frontline staff, and decision-makers.
>
> ### Nonprofit / Social Impact Scenarios
>
> **D: Access Barriers**
> *Why can't people access services designed for them?*
> Choose a service type and explore what prevents access. What constraints does each stakeholder group face?
>
> **E: The Volunteer Experience**
> *What makes volunteering sustainable—or not?*
> Explore why volunteers stay or leave. What tensions exist between volunteers, staff, and those served?
>
> **F: Mission vs. Operations**
> *How do mission-driven organizations navigate competing pressures?*
> Explore tensions between mission impact and operational sustainability. What trade-offs get made?

> [!warning]- Assignments Overview
>

>
> ### Session Schedule
>
> | Time | Min | Activity |
> |------|-----|----------|
> | 2:15 | 5 | OPENING: "Today you observe. Your only job is to notice, not interpret, not judge, just see. Write in your notebooks as you watch. No frameworks yet." Reminder: Find the Duct Tape entries in your notebook. Share screen. |
> | 2:20 | 12 | VIDEO 1 — Central Park (seasons). *Before starting:* "This is one location across time. What stays the same? What changes?" |
> | 2:32 | 11 | VIDEO 2 — NYC 1910s. *Before starting:* "Now we go back over a century. Watch how people move, interact, use space." |
> | 2:43 | 3 | VIDEO 3 — London (Watched Walker). *Before starting:* "Present day. A walker's perspective." |
> | 2:46 | 3 | VIDEO 4 — Shibuya walking. *Before starting:* "Tokyo. Notice your own reaction to the density." |
> | 2:49 | 2 | VIDEO 5 — Magyar, Stainless: Dadar. *Before starting:* "Last one. Just watch." (No framing—let it land.) |
> | 2:51 | 4 | SILENT WRITING: "Take a few minutes. Write what you noticed. Don't talk yet." |

> | Magyar, Stainless: Dadar | [Vimeo - Adam Magyar](https://vimeo.com/magyaradam) | 2 min |
>
> ### Debrief Structure (20 min)
>
> **Round 1 — Open noticing (5 min)**
> - "What did you see? No interpretations yet—just observations."
> - Cold call 3-4 students or use chat: "Drop one word for what you noticed."
>
> **Round 2 — Comparing contexts (7 min)**
> - "What was different about observing the 1910s footage vs. present-day?"
> - "How did the pace of Shibuya vs. London change what you noticed?"
> - "What did slowing down (Magyar) reveal that you'd have missed at normal speed?"
>
> **Round 3 — The act of observing (5 min)**
> - "Where did you catch yourself interpreting instead of observing?"
> - "What did you miss the first time that you'd look for if you watched again?"
> - "What was hard about this?"
>
> **Round 4 — Bridge to fieldwork (3 min)**
> - "When you do your TETHER observation this week, what will you do differently based on today?"
>
> ### Remote Engagement Tactics
>
> - **One-word chat:** After each video, ask students to drop one word in chat for what they noticed. Creates visible participation without interrupting flow.
> - **Notebook accountability:** "You'll share one observation from your notebook during debrief—make sure you're writing."
> - **Silence before Magyar:** Pause 3-4 seconds before starting. After it ends, let 5-10 seconds of silence sit before asking them to write.
>
> ### After Session

> ### Session Schedule
>
> | Time | Min | Activity |
> |------|-----|----------|
> | 2:15 | 10 | OPENING + SETUP: "Show your thinking, not polish. Traceability matters." Reminder: Find the Duct Tape entries in your notebook. Teams set up stations. |
> | 2:25 | 40 | GALLERY WALK: 7 teams x ~5 min per station rotation. One member stays at station, rest circulate. Leave written feedback at each station. |
> | 3:05 | 20 | MAKE SENSE: Teams read feedback received. Then class discussion: where was traceability clearest? What patterns across all seven stations? |
> | 3:25 | 10 | CLOSE: What feedback will you act on? What needs more work? Preview Session 11. |
>

> [!note]- Session 11: Assumption Audit + Stress Test
>
> **Wednesday, February 25, 2026 | 2:15-3:45 PM | McNair Hall**
>
> **Primary Design Abilities:** Experiment Rapidly, Build and Craft Intentionally
>
> ### Learning Objectives
>
> By the end of this session, learners will be able to:
> - Identify critical assumptions underlying solution concepts
> - Define kill criteria for concept validation
> - Stress test concepts through adversarial questioning
> - Iterate concepts based on assumption testing
>
> ### Session Schedule
>
> | Time | Min | Activity |
> |------|-----|----------|
> | 2:15 | 5 | OPENING: "What would have to be true for your concept to work? What would kill it?" Reminder: Find the Duct Tape entries in your notebook. |
> | 2:20 | 15 | EXPLORE: Assumption Audit. List 5 assumptions your concept depends on. Rank by criticality: if this is wrong, our concept fails. |
> | 2:35 | 15 | EXPLORE: Kill Criteria. For top 2 assumptions, define what evidence would kill the concept. Where would you find this evidence? Who would you talk to? |
> | 2:50 | 25 | EXPLORE: Stress Test. Teams pair up and try to break each other's assumptions. Adversarial Q&A—find the weaknesses, not the strengths. |
> | 3:15 | 15 | MAKE SENSE: What did the stress test reveal? What assumptions were weaker than expected? What needs to change? |
> | 3:30 | 5 | CLOSE: Final presentation expectations. Reminder: notebooks due Session 12. |
>
> ### After Session
> **Canvas:** Tell the Story of Your Project instructions
> 9-min team blocks, format of team's choice. Prototype required. Format rationale due 48 hours before Session 12.
