# Mid-Project Presentation

## Assignment Overview

The Mid-Project Presentation is a checkpoint to share your problem definition and early solution concepts with the class. This is not a final pitch. It's an opportunity to articulate your thinking, receive feedback, and identify what needs more work before the Final Presentation.

The goal is **traceability**: showing how your research led to your problem definition, and how your problem definition is guiding your solution directions.

## Learning Objectives

- Communicate problem definition clearly and concisely
- Demonstrate connection between empathy work and problem framing
- Present early solution concepts grounded in research
- Receive and integrate peer feedback
- Identify gaps and areas for further development

## Instructions

### Presentation Structure (5-6 minutes)

#### 1. The Problem (2-3 minutes)
- What problem is your team addressing?
- Who experiences it and why does it matter?
- What did you observe or learn that led to this framing?
- What makes this problem hard to solve? (reference your [[A03-Causal-Loop-Map|causal loop]])

#### 2. Early Concepts (2-3 minutes)
- What 1-2 solution directions are you exploring?
- How does each connect to specific research insights?
- What questions or uncertainties remain?
- What feedback would be most helpful?

### Q&A (2 minutes)
- Be prepared for questions about your research and reasoning
- It's okay (even good) to say "we're not sure yet" or "that's what we need to figure out"

### Presentation Guidelines

**Do:**
- Show your thinking, not polish
- Reference specific observations, quotes, or stakeholder insights
- Acknowledge what you don't know yet
- Ask for specific feedback

**Don't:**
- Create a polished sales pitch
- Present solutions as final
- Hide uncertainties
- Rush through research to get to solutions

### Visual Aids

- Slides are optional but can be helpful
- Your [[A03-Causal-Loop-Map|causal loop map]] and stakeholder maps are useful visuals
- Hand-drawn materials are welcome
- No slides required. You can present from your [[A04-Problem-Definition-Report|Problem Definition Report]]

## Deliverables

In Session 10 (Monday, February 23):
- [ ] Team presentation (5-6 minutes)
- [ ] Q&A participation (2 minutes)
- [ ] Slides (if used) uploaded to Canvas after session

## Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)

This assignment is graded on a **Meets Specifications / Revise** basis. All team members receive the same grade.

### Specification 1: Problem Clarity

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Problem is clearly articulated. Audience understands who experiences the problem, what it is, and why it matters. Problem scope is bounded and specific. | Problem is vague, confusing, or poorly scoped. Audience can't identify specific stakeholders affected. Problem is too broad or unclear. |

### Specification 2: Research Connection

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Presentation references specific observations, stakeholder insights, or research findings. Clear that the team conducted empathy work and learned from it. Problem definition is grounded in evidence. | Research section is vague or missing. No specific observations or quotes. Problem could have been defined without doing any research. |

### Specification 3: Solution Grounding

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Solution directions are connected to specific insights from research. Team can explain why their research points toward these directions. Solutions are presented as explorations, not final answers. | Solutions appear disconnected from research. No explanation of why research led to these directions. Solutions presented as finished without acknowledging uncertainty. |

### Specification 4: Presentation Delivery

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Presentation is 5-6 minutes (not significantly over or under). All team members contribute. Presentation is organized and followable. Team engages constructively with Q&A. | Significantly over or under time. One person dominates. Presentation is disorganized. Team is dismissive or unprepared for Q&A. |

### Specification 5: Openness to Feedback

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Team explicitly asks for feedback on specific aspects. Engages thoughtfully with questions and suggestions. Demonstrates awareness of what they still need to learn or figure out. | Team does not solicit feedback. Defensive in response to questions. Presents work as complete rather than in-progress. |

---

**Overall:** Assignment meets specifications when ALL FIVE specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the team should incorporate feedback for the Final Presentation.

## What Happens Next

Based on feedback from this presentation and the Session 11 Assumption Audit + Stress Test, you'll refine your problem definition and solution concepts for the [[A06-Final-Presentation|Final Presentation]] (Session 12).
