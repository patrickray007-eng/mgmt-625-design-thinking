# Design Thinking Notebook

## Assignment Overview

Your notebook is the artifact of your design thinking practice throughout this course. It contains your observations, sketches, maps, reflections, and in-class activities, the raw material of your learning journey.

Unlike polished deliverables, the notebook values process over presentation. It should show evidence of sustained engagement, not perfect documentation.

## Learning Objectives

- Maintain a continuous practice of documentation throughout the design process
- Capture observations, ideas, and reflections in real-time
- Create a personal reference for design thinking practices
- Develop the habit of externalizing thinking

## Instructions

### Required Entries

These are the core notebook components that will be assessed:

**[[A01-TETHER-Observation|TETHER Observation]]**
- Full 90-minute observation notes
- Assumptions noted in margins
- Reflection on the experience

**Find the Duct Tape (Weekly, Sessions 1-11)**
- Each week, identify and document one "duct tape" solution you encounter: a workaround, patch, or improvised fix that people use to deal with a broken process or poorly designed system
- Record: What is the workaround? What problem is it solving? Why does the "real" fix not exist?
- These entries accumulate throughout the course and should appear regularly in your notebook

**Stakeholder Map Drafts**
- Working drafts of stakeholder maps from your team project

**Causal Loop Drafts**
- First drafts and iterations of your [[A03-Causal-Loop-Map|causal loop map]]

**Problem Definition Iterations**
- Working drafts of problem statements showing how your thinking evolved

### Optional: In-Class Notes

In-class notes are not required, but including them can be a helpful way to demonstrate engagement throughout the course. Examples of what you might capture:
- Activity notes (Design Tapas, observation exercises, shadowing)
- Ideation outputs (HMW statements, Solutions Tic-Tac-Toe, hypothesis drafts)
- Feedback received from peers during presentations or stress testing
- Notes from other teams' presentations
- Reflections on what you learned in a given session

### What We're Looking For

This is graded on **completion and sustained engagement**, not on neatness or "correct" answers.

- Evidence that you used the notebook throughout the course (not filled in the night before)
- Entries from each phase of the course
- Your actual thinking. Messy is fine, empty is not

## Deliverables

Submit by Session 12 (Monday, March 2):
- [ ] Notebook (physical or digital) with entries from all 11 sessions
- [ ] Physical notebooks: collected in class and returned after grading
- [ ] Digital notebooks: submitted on Canvas before class

## Grading

Credit is awarded based on the number of specifications met.

### Specifications

**1. TETHER Documentation**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Notebook includes substantial TETHER observation notes (3-4+ pages). Notes reflect 90 minutes of sustained observation. Assumptions are noted. Reflection is present. | TETHER section is missing, sparse, or clearly rushed. Fewer than 2 pages of observation notes. No assumptions noted. No reflection. |

**2. Session Coverage**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Notebook includes entries from each major course phase: Sessions 1-4 (individual observation work), Sessions 5-8 (team problem definition), Sessions 9-11 (ideation and testing). Not every activity needs extensive notes, but each phase is represented. | Multiple phases are missing entirely. Notebook only covers a few sessions. Large gaps suggest the notebook wasn't used throughout the course. |

**3. Sustained Engagement**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Entries show evidence of real-time documentation (not reconstructed later). Notes include context-specific details that wouldn't be remembered later. Style varies naturally across sessions. Content couldn't have been created in one sitting. | Notebook appears to have been filled in all at once. Entries lack specific details. Formatting is suspiciously consistent. Content is generic enough to have been created without attending sessions. |

**4. Thinking Made Visible**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Notebook shows actual thinking: drafts, iterations, questions, dead ends. Includes stakeholder maps, causal loop attempts, ideation sketches, or other visual thinking. Evidence of working through ideas, not just recording final answers. | Notebook contains only final, polished outputs. No evidence of drafting or iteration. No visual thinking. Reads like a transcript, not a thinking tool. |

**5. Legibility**

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Notebook is legible (doesn't need to be neat, but can be read). Entries are roughly chronological. Clear enough to identify which entries correspond to which sessions/activities. | Illegible or unreadable sections. Pages completely out of order. Cannot determine what entries correspond to what activities. |

---

**Overall:** Credit is awarded based on the number of specifications met above.

## Note

The notebook is your artifact, not a performance. We're looking for evidence that you engaged with the work, not for beautiful documentation. Messy thinking captured in real-time is more valuable than polished notes created after the fact.
