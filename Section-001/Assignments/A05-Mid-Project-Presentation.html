<h1>Mid-Project Presentation</h1>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>The Mid-Project Presentation is a checkpoint to share your problem definition and early solution concepts with the class. This is not a final pitch. It's an opportunity to articulate your thinking, receive feedback, and identify what needs more work before the Final Presentation.</p>

<p>The goal is <strong>traceability</strong>: showing how your research led to your problem definition, and how your problem definition is guiding your solution directions.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Communicate problem definition clearly and concisely</li>
  <li>Demonstrate connection between empathy work and problem framing</li>
  <li>Present early solution concepts grounded in research</li>
  <li>Receive and integrate peer feedback</li>
  <li>Identify gaps and areas for further development</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Presentation Structure (5-6 minutes)</h3>

<h4>1. The Problem (2-3 minutes)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What problem is your team addressing?</li>
  <li>Who experiences it and why does it matter?</li>
  <li>What did you observe or learn that led to this framing?</li>
  <li>What makes this problem hard to solve? (reference your causal loop)</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Early Concepts (2-3 minutes)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What 1-2 solution directions are you exploring?</li>
  <li>How does each connect to specific research insights?</li>
  <li>What questions or uncertainties remain?</li>
  <li>What feedback would be most helpful?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Q&A (2 minutes)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Be prepared for questions about your research and reasoning</li>
  <li>It's okay (even good) to say "we're not sure yet" or "that's what we need to figure out"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Presentation Guidelines</h3>

<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Show your thinking, not polish</li>
  <li>Reference specific observations, quotes, or stakeholder insights</li>
  <li>Acknowledge what you don't know yet</li>
  <li>Ask for specific feedback</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Don't:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a polished sales pitch</li>
  <li>Present solutions as final</li>
  <li>Hide uncertainties</li>
  <li>Rush through research to get to solutions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Aids</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Slides are optional but can be helpful</li>
  <li>Your causal loop map and stakeholder maps are useful visuals</li>
  <li>Hand-drawn materials are welcome</li>
  <li>No slides required. You can present from your Problem Definition Report</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>In Session 10 (Monday, February 23):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team presentation (5-6 minutes)</li>
  <li>Q&A participation (2 minutes)</li>
  <li>Slides (if used) uploaded to Canvas after session</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)</h2>

<p>This assignment is graded on a <strong>Meets Specifications / Revise</strong> basis. All team members receive the same grade.</p>

<h3>Specification 1: Problem Clarity</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Problem is clearly articulated. Audience understands who experiences the problem, what it is, and why it matters. Problem scope is bounded and specific.</td>
      <td>Problem is vague, confusing, or poorly scoped. Audience can't identify specific stakeholders affected. Problem is too broad or unclear.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 2: Research Connection</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Presentation references specific observations, stakeholder insights, or research findings. Clear that the team conducted empathy work and learned from it. Problem definition is grounded in evidence.</td>
      <td>Research section is vague or missing. No specific observations or quotes. Problem could have been defined without doing any research.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 3: Solution Grounding</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Solution directions are connected to specific insights from research. Team can explain why their research points toward these directions. Solutions are presented as explorations, not final answers.</td>
      <td>Solutions appear disconnected from research. No explanation of why research led to these directions. Solutions presented as finished without acknowledging uncertainty.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 4: Presentation Delivery</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Presentation is 5-6 minutes (not significantly over or under). All team members contribute. Presentation is organized and followable. Team engages constructively with Q&A.</td>
      <td>Significantly over or under time. One person dominates. Presentation is disorganized. Team is dismissive or unprepared for Q&A.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Specification 5: Openness to Feedback</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Specification Met</th>
      <th>Specification Not Met</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Team explicitly asks for feedback on specific aspects. Engages thoughtfully with questions and suggestions. Demonstrates awareness of what they still need to learn or figure out.</td>
      <td>Team does not solicit feedback. Defensive in response to questions. Presents work as complete rather than in-progress.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> Assignment meets specifications when ALL FIVE specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the team should incorporate feedback for the Final Presentation.</p>

<h2>What Happens Next</h2>

<p>Based on feedback from this presentation and the Session 11 Assumption Audit + Stress Test, you'll refine your problem definition and solution concepts for the Final Presentation (Session 12).</p>
