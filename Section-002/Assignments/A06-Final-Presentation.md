# Final Presentation

## Assignment Overview

Your Final Presentation is the culmination of your team's design thinking work. You'll present your problem-to-solution arc to the class, demonstrating how your empathy work shaped your understanding and led to your solution hypotheses.

This is not a polished pitch. It's a demonstration of design thinking in action. The goal is **traceability**: showing how your research led to insights, how insights shaped your problem definition, and how your problem definition guided your solution concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- Communicate a complex problem-to-solution narrative clearly and concisely
- Demonstrate traceability from empathy work to solution concepts
- Present evidence-based reasoning to an audience
- Receive and respond to feedback constructively

## Instructions

### Presentation Structure (8-10 minutes)

With approximately 7 teams presenting, we need to keep presentations focused. Target 8-10 minutes total.

#### 1. The Problem (2-3 minutes)
- What problem did you investigate?
- Who experiences it and why does it matter?
- What makes this problem hard to solve? (tensions, feedback loops)

#### 2. Your Research Journey (3-4 minutes)
- How did your team leverage distributed research?
- What did you learn that you didn't expect?
- What specific insights shaped your understanding?
- Include at least 2-3 concrete examples: quotes, observations, or moments that mattered

#### 3. Your Solution Hypotheses (2-3 minutes)
- What 1-2 solution concepts are you proposing?
- How does each connect to specific research insights?
- What are the key assumptions underlying each concept?
- What would you test first if you had more time?

### Q&A and Stress Testing (4-5 minutes)
- Following your presentation, your classmates will conduct a stress test of your assumptions and reasoning
- This is a constructive exercise: your classmates' job is to pressure-test your logic, identify assumptions you may have missed, and surface alternative explanations
- Be prepared to answer questions about your research, reasoning, and assumptions
- It's okay to say "we don't know, that's an assumption we'd need to test"

### Presentation Guidelines

**Do:**
- Show your thinking, not just your conclusions
- Use specific evidence from your research
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Make the traceability visible (how did insight A lead to solution B?)

**Don't:**
- Create a polished sales pitch
- Hide uncertainties or assumptions
- Present solutions without grounding in research
- Rush through the research to get to the "good part" (the research IS the good part)

### Visual Aids

- Slides are optional but recommended
- If using slides: favor visuals (stakeholder maps, causal loops, research photos) over text
- Your traceability map from the [[A05-Problem-Definition|Problem Definition]] document is useful here
- Hand-drawn materials are welcome. This isn't about polish

## Deliverables

In Session 5 (Saturday, April 4):
- [ ] Team presentation (8-10 minutes)
- [ ] Q&A and stress testing participation (4-5 minutes)
- [ ] Slides or visual aids (if used) uploaded to Canvas after session

## Grading Rubric (Specifications-Based)

This assignment is graded on a **Meets Specifications / Revise** basis. All team members receive the same grade.

### Specification 1: Problem Clarity

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Problem is clearly articulated within the first few minutes. Audience understands who experiences the problem, what it is, and why it matters. Problem scope is bounded and specific. Explanation of why the problem persists (tensions, loops) demonstrates depth of understanding. | Problem is vague, confusing, or takes too long to articulate. Audience can't identify specific stakeholders affected. Problem is too broad or not clearly scoped. No explanation of why the problem persists. |

### Specification 2: Research Evidence

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Presentation includes 2-3 concrete examples from team's research: specific quotes, observations, or insights. Evidence is specific enough that it couldn't have been made up. Clear that the team actually conducted research and learned from it. Demonstrates how distributed research across different contexts added value. | Research section is vague or generic. No specific quotes or observations. Could have been written without conducting research. No evidence that the team learned something new. Distributed research advantage not demonstrated. |

### Specification 3: Traceability

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Clear logical chain from research → insights → problem definition → solution hypotheses. Audience can follow how specific insights led to specific solution directions. Solutions are grounded in evidence, not just ideas the team liked. The "why" behind solution choices is explained. | Solutions appear disconnected from research. No clear logic chain. Audience can't see how empathy work shaped the solution. Feels like solutions were decided early and research was retrofit. |

### Specification 4: Assumption Awareness

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Team identifies key assumptions underlying their solution hypotheses. Acknowledges what they don't know. Can articulate what they would test if they had more time. Demonstrates intellectual honesty about uncertainty. | Presents solutions as certainties. Does not acknowledge assumptions or uncertainties. Cannot answer questions about underlying assumptions. Overconfident without evidence. |

### Specification 5: Presentation Delivery

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Presentation is 8-10 minutes (not significantly over or under). All team members contribute meaningfully. Presentation is organized and easy to follow. Visual aids (if used) support rather than distract. Team handles Q&A and stress testing thoughtfully. | Significantly over or under time. One person dominates while others are silent. Presentation is disorganized or hard to follow. Visual aids are confusing or distracting. Team is dismissive or unprepared for Q&A. |

### Specification 6: Engagement with Feedback

| Specification Met | Specification Not Met |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Team engages constructively with Q&A and classmate stress testing. Answers are thoughtful and grounded in research. Team can distinguish between questions they can answer with evidence vs. assumptions they'd need to test. Open to feedback and critique. | Team is defensive or dismissive during Q&A and stress testing. Answers are vague or evasive. Cannot engage substantively with questions. Treats stress testing as an attack rather than an opportunity. |

**Overall:** Assignment meets specifications when ALL SIX specifications are met. If any specification is not met, the team may submit a written reflection for revision, using a group token.
